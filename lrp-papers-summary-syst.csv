"Effect of Ambient Light on the Number of Motorized Vehicles, Cyclists, and Pedestrians",@fotios_effect_2022,"Fotios, S., Robbins, C.J.",2022,1,,,,,1,1,empirical,,Darkness leads to significant reductions in pedestrians and cyclists but does not have a significant effect on the number of motorized vehicles
Extending observations of ambient light level and active travel to explore age and gender differences in reassurance,@fotios_extending_2022,"Fotios, S., Uttley, J., Gorjimahlabani, S.",2022,,,,1,,,1,empirical,,"The deterrence of darkness was similar for males and females, which disagrees with previous studies"
Environmental correlates of dock-less shared bicycle trip origins and destinations,@zacharias_environmental_2021,"Zacharias, J., Meng, S.",2021,1,,,,,1,1,empirical,,"Six factors are highly significant in higher uptake and deposit - the presence of a dedicated bicycle pathway, street lighting, sidewalks, bicycle parking lots, POI density, and street segment length"
Road lighting density and brightness linked with increased cycling rates after-dark,@uttley_road_2020,"Uttley, J., Fotios, S., Lovelace, R.",2020,1,,,,,1,1,empirical,,"Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased."
Bicycle facilities safest from crime and crashes: Perceptions of residents familiar with higher crime/lower income neighborhoods in Boston,@lusk_bicycle_2019,"Lusk, A.C., Willett, W.C., Morris, V., Byner, C., Li, Y.",2019,,,,1,,,1,empirical,qualitative,"Clean signs, balconies, cafes, street lights, no cuts between buildings, and flowers were low risk for crime and witnesses, little traffic, and bike signals low risk for crash. "
A whole-year approach showing that ambient light level influences walking and cycling,@fotios_whole-year_2019,"Fotios, S., Uttley, J., Fox, S.",2019,1,,,,,1,1,empirical,,"The results confirm that ambient light has a significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when they are unlit."
"The impact of weather, road surface, time-of-day, and light conditions on severity of bicycle-motor vehicle crash injuries",@asgarzadeh_impact_2018,"Asgarzadeh, M., Fischer, D., Verma, S.K., Courtney, T.K., Christiani, D.C.",2018,,1,,,,,1,empirical,,Crashes in low light conditions and during early morning hours are more likely to result in higher injury severity.
Using the daylight savings clock change to show ambient light conditions significantly influence active travel,@uttley_using_2017,"Uttley, J., Fotios, S.",2017,1,,,,,1,1,empirical,,"Odds ratios indicated the numbers of pedestrians and cyclists during the case period were significantly higher during daylight conditions than after-dark, resulting in a 62% increase in pedestrians and a 38% increase in cyclists"
Longitudinal associations between built environment characteristics and changes in active commuting,@yang_longitudinal_2017,"Yang, L., Griffin, S., Khaw, K.-T., Wareham, N., Panter, J.",2017,1,,,,,1,1,empirical,,Those living in neighbourhoods with more streetlights were more likely to take up active commuting
Lighting for cycling in the UK - A review,@fotios_lighting_2017,"Fotios, S., Castleton, H.F.",2017,,1,,,1,,1,review,,A number of actions are suggested that should enable lighting's contribution to the safety of cyclists to be realized.
The neighbourhood physical environment and active travel in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis,@cerin_neighbourhood_2017,"Cerin, E., Nathan, A., van Cauwenberg, J., Barnett, D.W., Barnett, A.",2017,1,,,,,1,1,review,,"Positive associations were also observed with food outlets, business/institutional/industrial destinations, availability of street lights, easy access to building entrance and human and motorised traffic volume.

"Road lighting effects on bicycle and pedestrian accident frequency: Case study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada",@nabavi_niaki_road_2016 ,"Nabavi Niaki, M.S., Fu, T., Saunier, N., (...), Amador, L., Bruneau, J.-F.",2016,,1,,,,,1,empirical,,"Unexpectedly, the result showed that an increase in road lighting was associated with more bicycle and pedestrian accidents, which might have been explained by the decision to add or increase the amount of lighting at locations in which accidents occurred."
"An epidemiological study of the risk of cycling in the dark: The role of visual perception, conspicuity and alcohol use",@twisk_epidemiological_2013,"Twisk, D.A.M., Reurings, M.",2013,,1,,,,,1,empirical,,"Cycling in late evening darkness is associated with higher injury rates than cycling in daylight conditions. In comparison to late evening darkness, relative injury rates in early morning darkness are much higher."
Effects of road lighting: An analysis based on Dutch accident statistics 1987-2006,@wanvik_effects_2009,"Wanvik, P.O.",2009,,1,,,,,1,empirical,,"Injury accidents in on lit roads are reduced by 50%. The effect on fatal accidents is slightly larger. The effect during twilight is about 2/3 of the effect in darkness. The effects on pedestrian, bicycle and moped accidents are significantly larger than the effects on automobile and motorcycle accidents. The risk of injury accidents was found to increase in darkness. The average increase in risk was estimated to 17% on lit rural roads and 145% on unlit rural roads. The average increase in risk with respect to pedestrian accidents is about 140% on lit rural roads and about 360% on unlit rural roads.  "
