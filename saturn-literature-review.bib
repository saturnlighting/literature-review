	abstract = {Road crashes in metropolitan areas are challenging to prevent because they stem from the interactions of drivers and other system users in intricate built environments. Recent theories indicate that features of the built environment may induce unsafe driving by shaping users’ expectations and behaviors. The availability of street view imagery and methods of scene parsing create new possibilities for understanding how features of the built environment inﬂuence crash incidence. Most previous crash research using street imagery has applied manual processing methods. In this paper, we develop and apply automated machine parsed imagery in conjunction with self-explaining roads theory to consider how the street space visible to drivers inﬂuences crash frequency, using data from Columbus, Ohio, USA. While controlling for road network and area characteristics, we model the association of individual street elements with crash frequency. We then conduct a cluster analysis to deﬁne four types of street spaces, which are used in a subsequent model. We ﬁnd that an Open Road type of metropolitan street space, characterized by more visible sky, roadway, and signage are associated with the greatest increase in crashes, and that the majority of these spaces exist on arterial or collector class road segments. We theorize that the visual similarity of this type of street space to highways promotes faster, less careful driving, which combines with their mixed land uses to make them the least safe. This points to the importance of trafﬁc calming for such roads in high-activity areas, and the need to differentiate environments of non-highways from highways to promote careful driving.},

Traditional methods of data collection are expensive, time consuming, and lack spatial and temporal detail. New sources have emerged as a result of crowdsourced data from ﬁtness apps, allowing cyclists to track routes using GPS enabled cell phones. Our goal is to determine if crowdsourced data from ﬁtness apps data can be used to quantify and map the spatial and temporal variation of ridership. Using data provided by Strava.com, we quantify how well crowdsourced ﬁtness app data represent ridership through comparison with manual cycling counts in Victoria, British Columbia. Comparisons are made for hourly, AM and PM peak, and peak period totals that are separated by season. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a Generalized Linear Model we modelled the relationships between crowdsourced data from Strava and manual counts and predicted categories of ridership into low, medium, and high for all roadways in Victoria. Our results indicate a linear association (r2 0.40 to 0.58) between crowdsourced data volumes and manual counts, with one crowdsourced data cyclist representing 51 riders. Categorical cycling volumes were predicted and mapped using data on slope, trafﬁc speeds, on street parking, time of year, and crowdsourced ridership with a predictive accuracy of 62\%. Crowdsourced ﬁtness data are a biased sample of ridership, however, in urban areas the high temporal and spatial resolution of data can predict categories of ridership and map spatial variation. Crowdsourced ﬁtness apps offer a new source of data for transportation planning and can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of ofﬁcial count programs.},

	abstract = {Cycling has a range of benefits as is recognised by national and international policies aiming to increase cycling rates. Darkness acts as a barrier to people cycling, with fewer people cycling after-dark when seasonal and time-of-day factors are accounted for. This paper explores whether road lighting can reduce the negative impact of darkness on cycling rates. Changes in cycling rates between daylight and after-dark were quantified for 48 locations in Birmingham, United Kingdom, by calculating an odds ratio. These odds ratios were compared against two measures of road lighting at each location: 1) Density of road lighting lanterns; 2) Relative brightness as estimated from night-time aerial images. Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased. These results suggest only a minimal amount of lighting can promote cycling after-dark, making it an attractive mode of transport year-round.},

An alternative approach is to use objective data, specifically the number of pedestrians and cyclists present under different lighting conditions. Such data have been reported previously using a daylight savings transition approach. This paper presents a different method for analysing the effect of ambient light conditions in which data from the whole year are examined, rather than only the two weeks either side of the biannual daylight savings clock changes. The results confirm that ambient light has a significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when they are unlit. While both methods use an odds ratio approach, which should account for environmental changes other than lighting, the results suggest the daylight savings method of analysis better isolates changes in weather from the effects of ambient light on travel choice than does the whole-year method.},

The data analysed were the height at which a rising obstacle was detected, this simulating an approaching irregularity in the road surface. The results suggest that when cycling on a lit road, cycle lighting frequently offers no benefit for peripheral detection and may make it worse. It was demonstrated that position matters: At low illuminances, a hub-mounted lamp improved detection over a handlebar-mounted lamp. This benefit was sufficient to offset the reduction in detection found when decreasing road lighting from 2.0 lux to 0.2 lux.},

Results of the previous analysis were reproduced in terms of the direction of the effect, but the repeated analysis found greater differences between daylight and darkness. The odds ratio determined using the new method led to higher odds ratios than the analyses used in some past studies, suggesting that past studies may have underestimated the detrimental effect of darkness on road traffic collision risk.},

Identifying the barriers and enablers to riding a bike for transport is essential to developing interventions that encourage bike riding. In this mixed-methods systematic review, we aimed to identify the perceived barriers and enablers to adults riding a bike for transport in Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) countries. A systematic database search was conducted to identify relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature. Fourty-ﬁve papers/reports met eligibility criteria. There were 34 barriers and 21 enablers identiﬁed. The leading barriers related to riding on the road alongside motor vehicles. Other factors identiﬁed included the provision and quality of cycling infrastructure, personal factors such as physical ﬁtness, attitudinal factors such as community perceptions of cyclists, and environmental factors. While this review highlights the complexity of factors that inﬂuence the uptake of riding a bike for transport, many of the leading factors could be overcome through the provision of high-quality protected infrastructure for bike riders. Other interventions to address other known barriers and enablers are needed to increase the uptake of bike riding.},

Overall, the level of evidence on the importance of bicycle parking is limited. The majority of studies are based on crosssectional data with the presence of parking as a binary independent variable. Most studies focus on bicycle parking at public transport stops and at work places. Few studies report on bicycle parking throughout cities, and hardly any on parking at residential locations. Bicycle parking supply and quality appears to be a determinant of cycling for current and potential cyclists. Our ﬁndings can serve as input for an evidence-based debate on the role of bicycle parking. For practitioners, our research supports investment in bicycle parking, but acknowledges that a proper evaluation of such initiatives needs to be conducted to increase the level of evidence.},

A web-based survey was conducted to understand the travel patterns and the specific issues regarding bicyclists. The survey included questions about possible bicycle infrastructure improvements, policy, and program innovations to assess the perceptions of the campus community regarding these changes. The findings of this survey, conducted to understand cyclists’ travel patterns and identify their issues and concerns, are discussed. Both nonbicycle commuters and bicycle commuters agreed that bicycle lanes, trails, and paths would encourage them to ride a bike (or ride more often) to the campus. Discrete choice models are estimated to model the commuters’ mode to campus. The findings of the models suggest that people are more sensitive to time for nonmotorized modes and women are less likely to ride a bicycle. Those who perceive walking and biking as a form of exercise and identify flexibility of departure time as an important factor in their mode choice are more likely to ride a bicycle. Those more likely to choose to drive an automobile to campus assume that they do not have other options to commute to campus. Policies designed to promote the use of bicycle transportation on and to the campus based on these findings are presented. The results of this study will help practitioners and campus transportation planners understand the reasons that prevent people from bicycling and evaluate the transportation improvements that may be considered to achieve bicycle-friendly campuses.},

To investigate gender equity, we develop a bivariate statistical analysis along with a twolevel nested logit model. The results of the bivariate statistical analysis indicate females are about 30\% less likely to bicycle from home to campus and are signiﬁcantly more sensitive to environmental and infrastructural conditions. Complementary to the bivariate statistical analysis, the results of the two-level nested logit model demonstrate that distant trips, longer travel times, not having access to a bicycle, and an unsafe environment avert females from bicycling. We also ﬁnd that undergraduate females are less likely to bike to campus than other group of students. The ﬁndings highlight that the integration of bicycle and transit services, advancing infrastructure to separate bicycle from motorized traﬃc, improving safety in bicycle facilities, and enhancing public knowledge about local bicycle routes promote bicycling among females.},

Whilst many UK cities have had some success increasing overall cycling numbers in recent years, women are still far less likely to cycle, often because of concerns with journey quality related to traﬃc safety and social safety. CLoS tools are used by planners and engineers to assess existing routes and ensure they are safe, direct and continuous. However, whilst CLoS tools are seen to provide objective measures of some principles, we argue that they fail to attribute enough importance to gendered diﬀerences in perceptions of social safety. Based upon qualitative go-along and interview data, we assess the Welsh CLoS tool, demonstrating that it allows routes considered to be unrideable by female cyclists to be designated as rideable because there is no requirement to take mandatory remedial action regarding what are shown to be critically low scores on indicators of social safety. Whilst larger studies are required to validate these ﬁndings, our data suggests that the safety component of the CLoS tool can only be considered objective from a male point of view and inadequately considers the perspectives and needs of women. Moreover, we argue that in mandating socially unsafe routes as safe, CLoS actively reproduces gendered ‘essences’ such as vulnerability. As a result we suggest that CLoS urgently needs to be incorporated into gender and equalities audits if it is to accurately reﬂect the needs of more diverse user groups.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A promising way to stimulate physical activity is to promote the choice for active modes of transport (walking and cycling). Over the past years, several interventions and policies have been implemented to stimulate this mode shift. However, information concerning the effectiveness of these interventions and policies is still limited. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the effectiveness of interventions designed to stimulate a shift from car use to cycling or walking and to obtain insight into the intervention tools that have been used to promote and/or implement these interventions.
Methods: Five databases were searched and articles published in English, Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish were included. Only studies that focussed on a mode shift from car use towards active transport in a general adult population, which were published in peer reviewed journals and which investigated effectiveness were included. Intervention tools used were categorized by using the model of Hoogerwerf \& Herweijer, as either legal, economic (subsidy, reward system, penalty), communicative (written materials, behavioural tools) and physical tools (providing bicycles, providing better bicycle facilities at work, adjustment of the environment).
Results: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Studies included described workplace-based interventions, architectural and urbanistic adjustments, population-wide interventions, and bicycle-renting systems. Nearly all studies (except three) showed positive effects concerning a mode shift. Most of the included studies used more than one intervention tool and the tools used differed between types of interventions. However, information about the statistical signiﬁcance of these results was often lacking and the study methodologies used were not of high quality.
Conclusion: Nearly all studies showed results in a positive direction. However, the quality of the included studies was mostly low and intervention characteristics were poorly described. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Previous research has investigated mode choice, travel destination, and other travel choices for 1 day only. However, it cannot be assumed that travel choices do not vary from day to day and that most individuals travel by the same transportation mode every day. Day-to-day decisions to cycle are affected by work characteristics, commute journey characteristics, and weather conditions. More specifically, workers wearing business attire, needing to transport goods, needing a car during office hours, having longer commute distances, commuting in the dark, and facing a higher wind speed or a more or longer duration of rain are less likely to commute by bicycle. Positive effects were found for temperature and the duration of sunshine. The results show that factors that can differ on a daily basis largely influence bicycle mode choice from day to day. The results show that two groups of part-time cyclists exist: occasional cyclists and frequent cyclists. Whereas the decisions of occasional cyclists to commute by bicycle are more affected by positive weather conditions, frequent cyclists are discouraged from cycling by more practical barriers, including wind speed and the need to be at multiple locations.},

We systematically reviewed the literature on neighbourhood physical environmental correlates of AT in older adults and applied a novel meta-analytic approach to statistically quantify the strength of evidence for environment-AT associations.
Methods: Forty two quantitative studies that estimated associations of aspects of the neighbourhood built environment with AT in older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) and met selection criteria were reviewed and meta-analysed. Findings were analysed according to five AT outcomes (total walking for transport, within-neighbourhood walking for transport, combined walking and cycling for transport, cycling for transport, and all AT outcomes combined) and seven categories of the neighbourhood physical environment (residential density/urbanisation, walkability, street connectivity, access to/availability of services/destinations, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, aesthetics and cleanliness/order, and safety and traffic).
Results: Most studies examined correlates of total walking for transport. A sufficient amount of evidence of positive associations with total walking for transport was found for residential density/urbanisation, walkability, street connectivity, overall access to destinations/services, land use mix, pedestrian-friendly features and access to several types of destinations. Littering/vandalism/decay was negatively related to total walking for transport. Limited evidence was available on correlates of cycling and combined walking and cycling for transport, while sufficient evidence emerged for a positive association of within-neighbourhood walking with pedestrian-friendly features and availability of benches/sitting facilities. Correlates of all AT combined mirrored those of walking for transport. Positive associations were also observed with food outlets, business/institutional/industrial destinations, availability of street lights, easy access to building entrance and human and motorised traffic volume. Several but inconsistent individual- and environmental-level moderators of associations were identified.
Conclusions: Results support strong links between the neighbourhood physical environment and older adults’ AT. Future research should focus on the identification of types and mixes of destinations that support AT in older adults and how these interact with individual characteristics and other environmental factors. Future research should also aim to clarify dose-response relationships through multi-country investigations and data-pooling from diverse geographical regions.},

	abstract = {Background: Empirical evidence suggests that an association between the built environment and physical activity exists. This evidence is mostly derived from cross-sectional studies that do not account for other causal explanations such as neighborhood self-selection. Experimental and quasi-experimental designs can be used to isolate the effect of the built environment on physical activity, but in their absence, statistical techniques that adjust for neighborhood self-selection can be used with cross-sectional data. Previous reviews examining the built environment-physical activity relationship have not differentiated among findings based on study design. To deal with self-selection, we synthesized evidence regarding the relationship between objective measures of the built environment and physical activity by including in our review: 1) cross-sectional studies that adjust for neighborhood self-selection and 2) quasi-experiments.Method: In September 2010, we searched for English-language studies on built environments and physical activity from all available years in health, leisure, transportation, social sciences, and geographical databases. Twenty cross-sectional and 13 quasi-experimental studies published between 1996 and 2010 were included in the review.Results: Most associations between the built environment and physical activity were in the expected direction or null. Land use mix, connectivity and population density and overall neighborhood design were however, important determinants of physical activity. The built environment was more likely to be associated with transportation walking compared with other types of physical activity including recreational walking. Three studies found an attenuation in associations between built environment characteristics and physical activity after accounting for neighborhood self-selection.Conclusion: More quasi-experiments that examine a broader range of environmental attributes in relation to context-specific physical activity and that measure changes in the built environment, neighborhood preferences and their effect on physical activity are needed. © 2011 McCormack and Shiell; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction: We describe and analyse a new, open dataset of surveyed cycling infrastructure in London UK. We demonstrate its potential to contribute to research and evidence-based policy development through a spatial analysis of infrastructure provision in London, before evaluating administrative boroughs on their infrastructure mix and compliance with UK Cycle Infrastructure Design Standards.
Methods: We processed and cleaned the 233,596 records in the London Cycling Infrastructure Database (CID) that contains nine infrastructure types. To support comparison between London boroughs, infrastructure provision was normalised to borough area, population size and level of commuter cycling. We generated variables capturing cyclist separation from motor vehicles and estimated cycle lane compliance for such segregation against design standards.
Results: Each CID record contains the infrastructure survey date, spatial location, infrastructurespecific variables and accompanying photographs. Traffic calming assets are numerous and distributed throughout London. Cyclist signals, crossings, Advanced Stop Lanes and cycle lanes and tracks are less numerous and more commonly seen in inner rather than outer London. Normalisation by area and population did not change these spatial patterns. Six percent of onroad cycle lane length is physically segregated from vehicles. Estimated compliance with UK design standards was notably higher for inner London boroughs with 66\% exceeding mean compliance compared to just 24\% of outer London boroughs.
Conclusions: In this first systematic description and analysis of the CID we have demonstrated its potential to quantitively and qualitatively compare infrastructure and a method to estimate compliance against design standards. We found that cycling infrastructure is not distributed equally across London and may not be of the quality that provides safe space for cycling. Such datasets are critical assets to evaluate infrastructure and guide health and transport policies.},

Personal safety is commonly cited in qualitative research as a barrier to local walking, yet the relationship between safety and constrained physical activity has received mixed support in quantitative studies. This paper reviews the quantitative evidence to date, seeking to explain the inconsistencies, and offers recommendations for future research.
Methods. A social–ecological framework was adopted to explore the evidence linking crime-related safety, and factors that inﬂuence real and perceived safety, with constrained physical activity.
Results. Perceived safety tends to affect the physical activity of groups already known to exhibit greater anxiety about crime; and some elements of the built environment that inﬂuence safety appear to constrain physical activity. However the evidence is somewhat inconsistent, and this may be partly attributed to measurement limitations. Many studies employ generic safety measures that make implicit references to crime or use composite variables that lack speciﬁcity. Physical activity outcomes also require consideration, as only activities occurring locally outdoors are likely to be affected by neighborhood crime.
Conclusions. Further research is required to tease out associations between real and perceived crimerelated safety and physical activity, ideally employing behaviour and crime-speciﬁc measures, and addressing the moderating role of the social and built environments.},

This paper examines if neighbourhood environments are associated with physical activity, especially walking and cycling. It analyses 608 respondent survey data from Washington State in the US and Geographic Information System-derived measures of the neighbourhood environment. Respondents reported trafﬁc volume to be the most signiﬁcant barrier, and good lighting to be the most important facilitator of walking and cycling. Utilitarian destinations, such as grocery stores, restaurants, retail stores and convenience stores, were signiﬁcant correlates of walking and moderate-intensity physical activities, while housing type, sports facility and transportation infrastructure were correlated with vigorous physical activities. Active people rated higher for their neighbourhood attributes including safety, visual quality, knowing neighbours, seeing many other people walking and cycling, and the availability of sports facilities, parks, and bike racks. Simple interventions such as street lighting, pavements/sidewalks, street trees, benches, bike lanes or trails, bike racks, and trafﬁc-calming devices appeared to hold some promise in promoting physical activities in neighbourhoods. Long-term solutions should include strategies to enhance overall aesthetics, safety, accessibility, street connectivity, and social interactions among neighbours.},

The results revealed that except for the walking distance, the trip purpose and travel status are the potential factors inﬂuencing the route choice of pedestrians. Furthermore, it was revealed that on-street parking, garbage bins, and streetlights could inﬂuence the pedestrians to select longer distance routes. In addition, pedestrians were more likely to select the shortest distance route when they were engaged in leisure activities with an accompanist.

	abstract = {The lack of physical activity has become a rigorous challenge for many countries, and the relationship between physical activity and the built environment has become a hot research topic in recent decades. This study uses the Strava Heatmap (novel crowdsourced data) to extract the distribution of cycling and running tracks in central Chengdu in December 2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and develops spatial regression models for numerous 500 × 500 m grids (N = 2,788) to assess the impacts of the built environment on the cycling and running intensity indices. The ﬁndings are summarized as follows. First, land-use mix has insigniﬁcant effects on the physical activity of residents, which largely contrasts with the evidence gathered from previous studies. Second, road density, water area, green space area, number of stadiums, and number of enterprises signiﬁcantly facilitate cycling and running. Third, river line length and the light index have positive associations with running but not with cycling. Fourth, housing price is positively correlated with cycling and running. Fifth, schools seem to discourage these two types of physical activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides practical implications (e.g., green space planning and public space management) for urban planners, practitioners, and policymakers.},

	abstract = {Objective: Pedestrian fatalities in the United States increased 51\% from 2009 to 2019. During that time, pedestrian fatalities occurring at night increased by 63.7\%, compared to a 17.6\% increase for pedestrian fatalities occurring during daylight conditions. Have there also been increases in serious, minor, and possible pedestrian injuries (i.e., have all pedestrian collisions been occurring more frequently)? Have pedestrian collisions been getting more severe (i.e., are there now higher proportions of more severe injuries)? Have trends differed between night and day? What role does street lighting play in the nighttime trends?
Methods: We analyzed pedestrian fatalities, serious injuries, minor injuries, and possible injuries that occurred in California, North Carolina, and Texas from 2010 to 2019 using linear regressions to explore the strength and statistical significance of trends. We then parsed these trends by lighting condition, exploring outcomes during the day and night and with and without street lighting.
Results: Findings suggest that increases in daytime minor (7.9\%) and possible (7.5\%) injuries closely mirrored increases in population (9.8\%). Increases in daytime fatal/serious injuries were significantly higher (43.1\% and 35.1\%, respectively), suggesting worsening severities during the day. Increases in nighttime minor/possible injuries (31.9\% and 27.6\%, respectively) were significantly larger than those during the day, suggesting that pedestrian collisions are occurring more frequently at night. Substantial increases in nighttime fatal/serious injuries (78.0\% and 74.7\%, respectively) likely reflect a combination of worsening severity (seen throughout the day) and increasing frequency (seen particularly at night). A pedestrian injured in the dark was found to be 5.0 times more likely to be killed than a pedestrian injured during the day. While a lack of street lighting does not seem to be the cause of the disproportionate increase in pedestrian injuries at night, pedestrians struck without a street light were 2.4 times more likely to be killed than those struck in the presence of a street light.
Conclusions: As we find ourselves in the midst of a pedestrian safety crisis, understanding that severities have increased throughout the entire day and frequencies have increased particularly at night helps illuminate a path forward.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Studies have shown that perceived security discourages pedestrians from walking, which in turn reduces physical activities and associated health benefits. However, there is a dearth of research about what elements of the built environment contribute to perceived security among pedestrians and, in particular, how the perception varies amongst women and amongst men in suburban environments. The present study aims to address this gap in the literature.
Methods: A range of scenarios (i.e. more/less diversity of land use, presence/absence of trees) were presented in an online experiment to 995 participants in Brisbane (Australia). Participants reported their perceptions of being assaulted/robbed/harassed in each scenario. Random effects ordered probit models were estimated for men and women to identify the association between perceived security and built environment factors, controlling for other confounders such as age and attitudes.
Results: Women have a higher perceived risk of being assaulted/robbed/harassed compared with men in all scenarios tested in the present study. Importantly, the results indicated that while residential, commercial, and mixed land use provide a sense of security for pedestrians compared to vacant land, the effect was larger for women compared to men. There were no significant differences between vacant and recreational land use in terms of perceived security. At night, pedestrians perceived suburban environments as insecure, and the change in the level of security was higher for women than men. Also, night time security varied over different land-use types between men and women.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that targeted urban design practices (e.g., functional use of vacant land, increasing diversity of land use, adequate street lights) could be used to improve perceived security and also reduce gender inequality in security perceptions. In turn, improved perceptions of security can help to increase walking as a mode of transport.},

	abstract = {While studies of bicyclist’s perceptions of crime and crash safety exist, it is also important to ask lower-income predominantly-minority residents what bicycle-route surface or context they perceive as safest from crime and crashes. With their insights, their chosen bike environments could be in engineering guidelines and built in their neighborhoods to improve residents’ health and lessen their risk of exposure to crime or crashing. This study involved two populations in Boston: (a) community-sense participants (eight groups-church/YMCA n = 116); and (b) street-sense participants (ﬁve groups-halfway house/homeless shelter/gang members n = 96). Participants ranked and described what they saw in 32 photographs of six types of bicycle environments. Quantitative data (Likert Scale 0–6 with 0 being low risk of crime/crash) involved regression analysis to test differences. Qualitative comments were categorized into 55 themes for surface or context and if high or low in association with crime or crashes. For crime, two-way cycle tracks had a signiﬁcantly lower score (safest) than all others (2.35; p {\textless} 0.01) and share-use paths had a signiﬁcantly higher score (least safe) (3.39; p {\textless} 0.01). For crashes, participants rated shared-use paths as safest (1.17) followed by two-way cycle tracks (1.68), one-way cycle tracks (2.95), bike lanes (4.06), sharrows (4.17), and roads (4.58), with a signiﬁcant difference for any two groups (p {\textless} 0.01) except between bike lane and sharrow (p = 0.9). Street-sense participants ranked all, except shared-use paths, higher for crime and crash. For surface, wide two-way cycle tracks with freshly painted lines, stencils, and arrows were low risk for crime and a cycle track’s median, red color, stencils, and arrows low risk for crash. For context, clean signs, balconies, cafes, street lights, no cuts between buildings, and ﬂowers were low risk for crime and witnesses, little trafﬁc, and bike signals low risk for crash. As bicycle design guidelines and general Crime Perception Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles do not include these details, perhaps new guidelines could be written.},

Pedestrian crossings are intended to make it safer to cross the road, but it is not clear whether they are eﬀective at doing this after-dark, compared with during daylight. Biannual clock changes resulting from transitions to and from daylight saving time were used to compare RTCs in the UK during daylight and darkness but at the same time of day, thus controlling for potential inﬂuences on RTC numbers not related to the ambient light condition. Odds ratios and regression discontinuity analysis suggested there was a signiﬁcantly greater risk of a pedestrian RTC at a crossing after-dark than during daylight. Results also suggested the risk of an RTC afterdark was greater at a pedestrian crossing than at a location at least 50 m away from a crossing. Whilst these results show the increased danger to pedestrians using a designated crossing after-dark, this increased risk is not due to a lack of lighting at these locations as 98\% of RTCs at pedestrian crossings after-dark were lit by road lighting. This raises questions about the adequacy and eﬀectiveness of the lighting used at pedestrian crossings.},

	abstract = {Background: Few studies have assessed the predictors of changes in commuting. This study investigated the associations between physical environmental characteristics and changes in active commuting.
Methods: Adults from the population-based European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort self-reported commuting patterns in 2000 and 2007. Active commuters were defined as those who reported ‘always’ or ‘usually’ walking or cycling to work. Environmental attributes around the home and route were assessed using Geographical Information Systems. Associations between potential environmental predictors and uptake and maintenance of active commuting were modelled using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and BMI.
Results: Of the 2757 participants (62\% female, median baseline age: 52, IQR: 50–56 years), most were passive commuters at baseline (76\%, n = 2099) and did not change their usual commute mode over 7 years (82\%, n = 2277). In multivariable regression models, participants living further from work were less likely to take up active commuting and those living in neighbourhoods with more streetlights were more likely to take up active commuting (both p {\textless} 0.05). Findings for maintenance were similar: participants living further from work (over 10 km, OR: 0.06; 95\% CI: 0.25 to 0.13) and had a main or secondary road on route were more likely to maintain their active commuting (OR: 0.52; 95\% CI: 0.28 to 0.98). Those living in neighbourhoods with greater density of employment locations were less likely to maintain their active commuting.
Conclusions: Co-locating residential and employment centres as well as redesigning urban areas to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists may encourage active commuting. Future evaluative studies should seek to assess the effects of redesigning the built environment on active commuting and physical activity.},

A highly influential factor is the lack of visibility at nighttime. Several studies have shown the negative effects of the lack of visibility on bicycle and pedestrian accident frequency and injury severity at nighttime. However, these studies considered only the presence or absence of light, which was not sufficient to evaluate road user safety. Only a limited number of studies in this field actually measured nighttime road illuminance levels. This study relied on the collection of road illuminance data on road links during the nighttime in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada, through the use of an illuminance sensor mounted on a scooter. Pedestrian and bicycle accident frequencies were analyzed separately with the use of the negative binomial model. Unexpectedly, the result showed that an increase in road lighting was associated with more bicycle and pedestrian accidents, which might have been explained by the decision to add or increase the amount of lighting at locations in which accidents occurred. The presence of a bike facility and arterial roads was associated with a decrease in bicycle accident occurrence. For pedestrians, the number of lanes per link and the pedestrian flow were associated with an increase in nighttime accident frequency, while the vehicle flow was associated with a decreasing number of accidents. The study called for more investigation of the precise relationship between safety and the amount of light provided by road lighting.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns road lighting for pedestrians and how this aids reassurance, their confidence when walking alone after dark. Evidence from past studies that lighting enhances reassurance is supported by the findings of an unfocussed approach that aimed deliberately to avoid focus on lighting or fear, thus to counter the unintended potential for focussed, quantitative methods to lead towards such a finding. Review of the characteristics of lighting suggests an optimum illuminance of 10 lux, of high S/P ratio, and aimed toward the pedestrian and natural elements of the environment, will enhance reassurance. Further research is needed to validate the optimum illuminance, the appropriate metric for characterising lamp spectral power distribution, and the most desirable aims of spatial distribution.},

We seek to answer two research questions: how does the built environment affect perceived safety from crime and walking behaviour; and how does one’s perception of safety from crime affect his/her walking behaviour. Our results show that the built environment is not only signiﬁcantly related to walking behaviour, as previous research has identiﬁed, but also correlated with people’s perception of safety. In addition, a signiﬁcant association between perceived safety from crime and walking behaviour is found, revealing possible indirect impacts of the built environment on walking. In speciﬁc, people living in neighborhoods with good accessibility and pedestrian facilities tend to perceive their neighborhoods safer while density has an opposite impact. Moreover, residents in safe and high-density areas are more likely to walk.},

Reported environmental inﬂuences on activity participation include climate, level of pollution, street lighting, trafﬁc conditions, accessibility and appropriateness of services and facilities, socio-economic conditions, aesthetics, pedestrian infrastructure, community life, exposure to antisocial behaviour, social network participation, environmental degradation, level of urbanism, exposure to natural settings, familiarity with local environment and others. Recommendations for future research include the need for innovative research methods; involvement of older adults as research collaborators; investigation of wider aspects of the active ageing concept; in-depth assessment of the environmental characteristics of areas; investigation of the pathways leading from environment to health and activity participation; and more theoretically informed research or increased contribution of research to theory development.},

Visual accessibility was predicted by visual field, environmental trust and brightness. Danger was predicted by the pleasantness of the lighting, gender, brightness and environmental trust. Consequently, the influence of individual characteristics, including the subjective judgments of brightness and hedonic tone and the personality dimension of trust in the physical environment, should be considered in the design of exterior lighting for urban footpaths.},

In conditions of generous bicycle supply and the ability to park a bicycle almost anywhere, it is important to know what local conditions might be influential in its use. The present study considered the role of 13 environmental factors in uptake and deposit rates by street segment, in a sample from a database of more than 3 m records over a ten-day period in May 2017, in Beijing, China. Street segments, defined by intersections, were coded for environmental factors using satellite and street view imagery. Uptake and especially deposit rates vary greatly by street segment and by local area. Linear regression reveals that 6 factors are highly significant in higher uptake and deposit – the presence of a dedicated bicycle pathway, street lighting, sidewalks, bicycle parking lots, POI density, and street segment length – while 3 were highly significant in lower uptake rates – interruptions in bicycle lane continuity, distance to the metro station, and elaborate environmental design. Altogether, environmental factors account for 42.4\% of the variance in local bicycle trip origins and 38.7\% of variance in destinations on street segments. This research contributes new understanding of the important role of local environmental factors in higher bicycle mode share in the context of a dock-less rental bicycle system.},

Data were obtained from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (n = 8547, aged 18–65). Active transportation (walking and cycling) was assessed using the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Speciﬁcally, trafﬁc density and speed as well as street lightening, visibility of residents regarding pedestrians and bicyclists, trafﬁc lights and crosswalks, safety of public spaces during the day and at night, crime rate during the day and at night were used to evaluate perceived neighborhood safety. Slow trafﬁc speeds, unsafe public spaces during the day, and crime during the day were associated with ≥10 min/week vs. {\textless}10 min/week of walking. Furthermore, drivers exceeding the speed limit and crime rate during the day were associated with reporting ≥10 min/week vs. {\textless}10 min/week of cycling. These results indicate a stronger association of the perceived neighborhood safety with walking compared to cycling.},

	abstract = {Cycling is a vital transport mode for many of the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) cities given the limited transport options that exist. Despite its enormous commuting importance in SSA cities, little scientiﬁc research has attempted to identify key factors inﬂuencing cycling adoption, and most existing cycling promotional initiatives are often not contextualised to the African cities. To underpin appropriate incentives to promote bicycle commuting, this study conducts a literature review to identify key determinants of bicycle use in SSA cities. Moreover, it identiﬁes key differences and similarities with cycling studies from the developed world cities (DWC). A survey of relevant literature was conducted through the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Google scholar. This allowed gathering 61 relevant empirical study materials that helped to identify main factors inﬂuencing cycling in both SSA and DWC urban contexts, based on the socio-economic, built-environment, weather conditions and environmental and attitudinal factors. The results found that the vast list of factors inﬂuencing cycling, such as gender, education level, income, street signage, road encroachment, weather change, travel distance, the opportunity for ﬂexible jobs and image prestige present a deep difference between studies in the two urban contexts. Street lighting, rain and tree cover present more consensual understanding among researchers in both urban contexts. This study reinforces that knowledge on cycling and its promotional initiatives should not be generalized, but rather be focused on the contextual setting of a particular city. In review of the past studies the limitation observed is that some speciﬁc characteristics of cycling in SSA cities such as the use of bicycle for commercial purpose is not covered in most cycling literature from the DWC. Given the observed contextual differences between cities from SSA and DWC, the study suggests the need for further research in quantifying and comparing the strength of the similarities and differences in cycling behaviour inﬂuences.},

	abstract = {A cyclist is a vulnerable road user whose interaction with the road infrastructure depends on several factors, including variable environmental conditions of lighting and meteorological road surface. This paper is concerned with nanoscopic crash modelling under the riskiest environmental conditions. There are very few works in the literature dealing with such modelling. An intelligent methodological framework consisting of the data collection unit and a knowledge processing unit (KPU) is proposed. In the knowledge processing unit, a combination of a) Statistical, b) Data learning and c) Casual inference methods are applied for investigating crashes on the study area of Tyne and Wear county in North-East of England. Three predictive nanoscopic road safety models are constructed (with 86\% accuracy) using a) Spatial, b) Personal, and c) Infrastructure input variables. The importance of each of the identiﬁed input variable is estimated by deep learning and statistically validated through chi-square test and Cramer’s V statistic. It is found that unsafeness of interaction between rider and infrastructure depends on lighting and road surface meteorological conditions. Different environmental conditions present a varying degree of risk to different types of infrastructure. The riskiest environment conditions are signiﬁcantly affected by rider’s gender and age, trafﬁc ﬂow regime, speciﬁc riding manoeuvre, and the road hierarchy difference. The increase in the number of variables, a rider encounters during his entire trip, imparts risky riding behaviour, affecting its safe interaction with the infrastructure. A novel infrastructure variable, i.e. ‘functional road hierarchy level and direction’ introduced in this work, is found to be a critical road safety variable. A shift in road safety analysis towards nanoscopic modelling can help achieve zero-vision road trafﬁc fatality. The study reinforces the need to plan and design infrastructure to move towards a more holistic approach while considering this vulnerable road user’s limitations.},

Gathering residents’ perceptions of these barriers can help public agencies develop effective and equitable strategies to create more sustainable transportation systems. We analyzed open-ended responses to the 2020 Milwaukee Safe and Healthy Streets survey to identify common traffic safety barriers (e.g., driver behavior such as speeding and redlight-running) and personal security barriers (e.g., undesirable street behaviors such as gun violence, robbery, and assault) to walking and bicycling. Then, we developed binary logistic models to identify perceptions of neighborhood characteristics, and individual demographic characteristics related to perceiving walking or bicycling as unsafe with respect to traffic or personal security. For walking, respondents’ traffic safety concerns were most strongly associated with perceptions of fast neighborhood traffic speeds, and personal security concerns were associated with perceptions of poor neighborhood cleanliness. For bicycling, both traffic safety concerns and personal security concerns were most strongly associated with poor neighborhood opportunities for exercise. At an individual level, living in a zero-vehicle household and having self-reported poor health were associated with rating traffic safety for both walking and bicycling as unsafe; having disabilities was associated with rating walking as unsafe. In almost every aspect of our analysis, respondents living in lower-income communities reported greater barriers to pedestrian and bicycle safety and security than residents from wealthier neighborhoods. The results emphasized the importance of both the social and physical environment for improving pedestrian and bicycle transportation.},

Overall, 32.8\% of adolescents walked to school, and only 1.2\% cycled. More adolescents reported sufficient foot­ paths than cycle paths (77.9\% vs 42.3\%) in their school neighbourhoods. Compared to walking, adolescents reported that their school neighbourhood environments provided less support for cycling to school, including fewer crossings/signals for cyclists versus pedestrians (52.8\% vs 69.3\%), fewer street lights (cycling vs walking; 57.9\% vs 70.3\%) and fewer destinations within easy cycling versus walking distance from their school (65.5\% vs 50.4\%) (all p{\textless}0.05). Active transport users perceived lower traffic volume, higher traffic speed, and fewer hilly streets along the walking and cycling routes to school than motorised and mixed transport users (all p{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a burgeoning demand for active travel (walking or cycling), which is a healthy, pollution-free, and affordable daily transportation mode. Park green space (PGS), as an open natural landscape, have become a popular destination for active travel trips in metropolitan areas. Pedestrians and cyclists are often at high crash risk when exposed to complicated trafﬁc environments in urban areas. Therefore, this study aims to propose a safety assessment framework for evaluating active travel trafﬁc safety (ATTS) near PGS from the perspective of urban planning and exploring the effect of the point-of-interest (POI) aggregation phenomenon on ATTS. First, links between ATTS and the environment variables were investigated and integrated into the framework using the catastrophe model. Second, the relationship between the POI density and ATTS was investigated using three spatial regression models. Results in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area as a case study have shown that (1) the population density, road density, nighttime brightness, and vegetation situation near PGS have pronounced effects on ATTS; (2) pedestrians near PGS enjoy safer road facilities than cyclists. Active travel trafﬁc near PGS requires more attention than non-park neighborhoods; (3) among four park categories, using active travel to access theme parks is the safest; and (4) SEM has the best ﬁt for POI cluster research. Increases in leisure facility density and residence density may lead to deterioration and improvement in ATTS safety levels near PGSs, respectively. The safety framework can be applied in other regions because the selected environment indicators are common and accessible. The ﬁndings offer appropriate trafﬁc planning strategies to improve the safety of active travel users when accessing PGS.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the results of a recently concluded R\&D project, SCALS (Smart Cities Adaptive Lighting System), which aimed at the development of all hardware/software components of an adaptive urban smart lighting architecture allowing municipalities to manage and control public street lighting lamps. The system is capable to autonomously adjust street lamps’ brightness on the basis of the presence of vehicles (busses/trucks, cars, motorcycles and bikes) and/or pedestrians in speciﬁc areas or segments of the streets/roads of interest to reduce the energy consumption. The main contribution of this work is to design a low cost smart lighting system and, at same time, to deﬁne an IoT infrastructure where each lighting pole is an element of a network that can increase their amplitude. More generally, the proposed smart infrastructure can be viewed as the basis of a wider technological architecture aimed at offering value-added services for sustainable cities. The smart architecture combines various sub-systems (local controllers, motion sensors, video-cameras, weather sensors) and electronic devices, each of them in charge of performing speciﬁc operations: remote street segments lamp management, single street lamp brightness control, video processing for vehicles motion detection and classiﬁcation, wireless and wired data exchanges, power consumptions analysis and trafﬁc evaluation. Two pilot sites have been built up in the project where the smart architecture has been tested and validated in real scenarios. Experimental results show that energy savings of up to 80\% are possible compared to a traditional street lamp system.},

Fatality rates are higher at night than in the day when adjusted for distances travelled, particularly for crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists. Although there are multiple contributory factors, the low light levels at night are believed to be the major cause of collisions with pedestrians and cyclists at night, most likely due to their reduced visibility. Understanding the visibility problems involved in nighttime driving is thus critical, given the increased risk to road safety.},

	abstract = {Provision of sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation systems that creates adequate travel alternatives for end users is desirable in transportation industry. Complete streets, a system that is oriented towards designing streets to safely accommodate users of all modes and abilities has been seen as a potential solution to satisfy the need for variability in transportation mode choices. While complete street concept has great advantages, there is still concern about the safety of vulnerable road users sharing roads with high speed vehicles. Among other things, factors such as vehicle speed and lateral separation of vehicles from pedestrians and bicyclist has been found to affect the pedestrian level of service (LOS), as well as LOS for bicyclists. While there is interest in increasing the use of active transportation modes, there is also a great need to ensure that infrastructures for active transportation modes are not only safe, but also gives the end users a reasonable feeling of safety. Using basic principle of kinetic energy, this study evaluates some factors to consider when making policy decisions on sharing of limited road spaces. This study also presents pertinent research areas, and recommendations on how to achieve improvement in road, and vehicle designs, as well as driver behavior to result in overall improvement in transportation safety for vulnerable road users.},

The focus of this project is to design a system of street lights controller to provide a reduction in power consumption. The prototype was designed by using Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), Infrared sensor (IR), battery and LED. The brightness of the lamps is being controlled in this project to reduce the power consumption. The dimming of the lamps depends on the speed of object motion detected such as pedestrians, cyclists and cars. The higher speed of moving object, the greater the level of intensity. For this idea, the innovation of street lights is not quite the same as conventional street lights that are controlled by timer switch or light sensor which automatically turns light on during sunset and off during sunrise. According to the study, motion detection devices may help to save up to 40\% of energy per month.},

With the increasing demand for nonconventional energy resources, the conservation of energy is an important domain in current research. The various existing street light systems all around the world use old technology, therefore are not optimized, inefficient and hence consume more power. On account of this, we often find street lights switched ON even when there is no vehicular or pedestrian movement on the roads. Due to the advancement in technology, automated systems are being preferred over manual systems. Considering this, our automated system refers to Smart Street Lighting System that adapts to movement by pedestrians, cyclists and cars.

The research and calculations revealed that probability of traffic accidents at day time is approximately 0.000001 vehicles·km, while at dark time it can increase from 15 to more than a hundred percent in case when the asphalt road surface is dry and the driving speed range is from 20 to 50 km·h-1. In the case of a wet asphalt surface this probability increases from 20 to more than 140 percent correspondingly and in the case the asphalt road surface is covered with ice – from 40 to {\textgreater}200 percent. The calculation results show that a safe vehicle stopping distance in nonilluminated roads at dark time will be guaranteed, if the speed of the vehicle does not exceed 40 km·h-1.},

Reducing power consumption leads to a reduction in brightness of lamps. This kind of street lighting states to open street lighting that adapts to movement by cars, walkers or cyclists. The system will work as adaptive street lighting. Lights will be obscured when no action is detected and will light up when some movement is detected. For this situation, the lighting framework is not quite the same as old-fashioned, static enlightenment, or dimmable road lighting that diminishes at pre-decided circumstances. Excessive lighting can be banned by targeted dimming of zones of the city, roads or individual luminaires. According to traffic and crowd, the light intensity will be controlled. This paper also incorporates light sensors which will be useful in a rainy environment. Number of street lights will be controlled by the user at a remote place. The complete system will work on RTC where lights will be running at 100\% intensity in peak traffic time and with reduced intensity after peak traffic time.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses an important issue related to nighttime commuting of low-income shift workers who walk and/or bike to their workplace using public transit. A shift worker is anyone who follows a work schedule that is outside of the typical daytime working hours of a business day and commute after dark - by walking or bicycling to a transit stop. However, poor visibility conditions on sidewalks and bicycle lanes often thwart safety of their walking and bicycling activities. Therefore, this paper develops two simple scores - nighttime accessibility score for walking (NASW) and nighttime accessibility for bicycling (NASB) - for evaluating nighttime infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclist. The scores consider the employment data, travel time and the physical distribution of streetlight poles along the sidewalks and bicycle lanes. Data from the city of El Paso in Texas is used to demonstrate the applicability of the two scores. Employment data from three prominent service industry sectors known to employ low-income shift workers – i) Retail Trade, ii) Accommodation and Food Services, and iii) Health Care and Social Assistance – are used for demonstration purposes. It is observed that amongst the three sectors analyzed, both NASW and NASB values are higher for regions in El Paso with low-income employment concentrations from the Health Care and Social Assistance sector. It is also observed that some prominent regions in north-east, south-east and west of El Paso need improvements in streetlight systems, sidewalks and bicycle network to facilitate walking and bicycling amongst low-income shift workers employed in Retail Trade, and Accommodation and Food Services industry sectors to access transit stops at night.},

However, the vulnerability of cyclists to severe injuries in crashes can discourage road users from cycling. Therefore, the study of the factors that affect the safety of cyclists is important. This paper describes an investigation of the relationship between cyclist–motorist crashes and various traffic zone characteristics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The goal was to assess the impacts of socioeconomics, land use, the built environment, and the road facility on cyclist safety through the use of macrolevel collision prediction models. The models were developed by generalized linear regression and full Bayesian techniques. An actual bike exposure indicator (the number of bike kilometers traveled) and the number of vehicle kilometers traveled were used as exposure variables in the models. The safety models showed that cyclist–motorist crashes were nonlinearly associated with an increase in bike, vehicle, and transit traffic as well as socioeconomic variables (i.e., population, employment, and household densities), variables related to the built environment (transit stop, traffic signal, and light pole densities), commercial area density, and the proportion if arterial–collector roads. The models revealed, however, a decline in cyclist–motorist crashes in association with an increase in the proportions of local roads and off-street bike links and an increase in recreational and residential area densities. The spatial effects were accounted for in the full Bayes models and were found to be significant; such a finding implies the importance of consideration of the spatial correlation in the development of macrolevel cyclist safety models.},

This research was quantified through several data-collection activities: ( a) observational counts of bicycle-to-rail commuters, ( b) inventories of bicycle infrastructure, ( c) an intercept survey of bicycle-to-rail commuters, and ( d) a focus group of bicycle-to-rail commuters. These data showed that bicycling to rail stations was an important yet underserved part of the commuter network in New Jersey. The data also showed that improvements to bicycling infrastructure at and around stations were vital to increase the rate of bicycle-to-rail commuters. Together, these activities provided detailed information about bicycle-to-rail commuters, as well as a benchmark for the evaluation of future conditions. The study found that those who bicycled to stations typically were male, white, and between the ages of 25 and 44 years. Most of these riders had earned college or postgraduate degrees and were members of a high-earning household. Survey and focus group participants were concerned mostly about safety on roads and at stations. Participants advocated for more bicycle lanes, on-street lighting, police security at stations, and better bicycle parking. Finally, the station inventory revealed that bicycle parking could be expanded at some stations to and from which bicycling was popular. The road inventory showed that most roads had speed limits at or below 25 mph and fewer than four lanes. However, just 2\% had any on-street bicycle infrastructure.},

This study investigated the impacts of illuminance on nighttime crash occurrence and nighttime crash injury severity at urban signalized intersections. Illuminance data and crash data for a sample of 91 signalized intersections were collected from the Tampa Bay region in Florida. The negative binomial model and the probit model were developed to examine the safety effects of intersection illuminance in terms of crash frequency and the risk of fatality and severe injury, respectively. The models showed that an increase in intersection illuminance from low ({\textless}0.2 fc) to medium (≥0.2 fc and {\textless}1.1 fc) could reduce nighttime crash frequency and night-to-day crash ratios by approximately 50\%. When illuminance was kept at 0.9 fc or higher, the risk of fatality and severe injury decreased significantly, especially in crashes that involved pedestrians and bicycles, head-on crashes, and angle crashes.},

	abstract = {Light-emitting diode (LED) road lighting has been widely implemented in recent years, but few studies have evaluated its performance after installation. This study investigated whether LED road lighting complies with minimum regulations in terms of trafﬁc safety and whether improvements for energy efﬁciency are possible. Average road surface luminance (L), overall luminance uniformity (Uo), longitudinal luminance uniformity (UI), power density (PD) and normalised power density (PN) were evaluated for 14 roads (seven designed for vehicular trafﬁc and seven for pedestrians and bicycles). Energy savings were calculated as the percentage reduction to the minimum level of the existing lighting class or a lower lighting class and by applying a dimming schedule. The results showed that LED road lighting for vehicular trafﬁc roads generally fulﬁlled the requirements, whereas that for pedestrian and bicycle roads generally corresponded to the lowest lighting class for L, and often did not meet the statutory requirements for Uo and UI. By adapting lighting levels to the minimum requirement of the existing lighting class or by dropping to a lower lighting class, vehicular trafﬁc roads could save 6\%–35\% on L to lighting class M5 and 23\%–61\% on L to lighting class M6. A dimming schedule could lead to energy savings of 49\%. There is little potential for savings on pedestrian and bicycle roads, except by implementing a dimming schedule. Thus, in general, for vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle roads, a dimming schedule can save more energy than can be achieved in general by reducing lighting class. Furthermore, since a dimming schedule can be adjusted to trafﬁc intensity, any potential risk of compromising trafﬁc safety is minimised.},

Bicycling facilities also provide bicyclists with a more enjoyable and safer feeling experience. An estimate of the total welfare change, or net benefits, associated with providing improved bicycle facilities should therefore include the value of these additional benefits. This study estimates welfare change as willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements in bicycling facilities using several different methods to value travel time. Three types of improvements are considered: cycle tracks, bicycle lanes, and street lighting. A stated preference survey asked respondents to choose between different levels of bicycle facility improvements and travel time, and also asked respondents for their average and marginal wage rates. Cycle tracks were valued the most, followed by street lighting and bicycle lanes. Greater cycling experience was associated with lower WPT, although increasing age was associated with higher WTP. WTP estimated from either average or marginal wage rates produced similar results, whereas the regional wage rate produced much higher WTP estimates.

The important findings include the following: (1) most fatal crashes were related to e-bike riders’ aberrant driving behaviors, including driving in motorized lanes, red-light running, driving against the direction of traffic, inattentive driving, and drunk driving; (2) e-bike riders with lower educational background tended to perform illegal or inattentive driving behaviors in fatal crashes; (3) most drivers were not found to commit any faults and very few drivers were found to commit drunk driving offences; (4) most nighttime fatal crashes were related to absence of street lightings; (5) heavy good vehicles (HGVs) and small passenger cars were the two vehicle types that were mostly involved in the e-bike fatal crashes.

	abstract = {Background: The prevention of road traffic accidents should be considered a serious public health concern, since they are the eighth leading cause of death globally and the main cause of death for young people aged 15–29. Evidences from many countries show that successes in preventing road traffic injuries can be achieved through concerted efforts at national level. The aim of our study was to assess the effectiveness of two interventions to prevent road traffic accidents: the introduction of graduated driver licensing (GDL) and the interventions to improve pedestrian and cyclist visibility.
Methods: Our search started with a scoping review on the interventions to prevent road traffic accidents to allow the development of a logical framework of traffic accidents. Specific and answerable questions formulated according to PICO scheme and combinations of keywords were used to perform a systematic search in the following databases: Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Evidence, Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) and Google. References of selected papers were searched. Only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were eligible. No temporal limits or linguistic filters were applied.
Results: 160 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were found for the question of the introduction of GDL program and 188 on the improvement of visibility in cyclists and pedestrians. After selection, four papers were included in qualitative synthesis for each question. All included studies underwent quality evaluation. GDL programs seem to be effective in reducing crash rates among young drivers, in particular in 16 yearold. Programs with more restrictions seem also to reduce fatal events. To improve visibility of pedestrians and cyclists, street lighting has been suggested as an intervention able to improve driver’s visual capabilities and ability to detect roadway hazards and to prevent car crashes. Visibility aids (fluorescent materials, lamps, flashing lights and retroreflective materials) have the potential to increase visibility and enable drivers to detect pedestrians and cyclists earlier.
Conclusions: The two interventions seem to be effective, but further examinations are needed to measure long-term effects. It is necessary to provide feasible studies in local context to estimate the impact of introduction of GDL programs or of some of their components and to improve interventions to increase visibility of pedestrians and cyclists.},

In 2005, research team members examined existing lighting conditions. The team considered existing spill lighting from nearby buildings and roadways. Following industry procedures, they took sample light meter readings utilizing a hand-held lux meter. After a five year delay in Federal funding, construction on the illuminated pedestrian and bike path project commenced. The bike path project, including the installation of high pressure sodium illumination by acorn head pole fixtures, was accepted by Federal and University officials. Immediately after the path’s completion in 2012, the researchers re-measured light levels at the site. They compared their pre- and post-installation measurements to the industry recommendations in effect during these two time periods. The researchers also used a digital sky quality meter to determine light pollution in the vicinity of the path. The path is currently in use by the University and community stakeholders.},

This study found that high-crime neighborhoods tend to discourage residents from walking or riding a bicycle. When a high-crime neighborhood is compared with a lower-crime neighborhood, the odds of choosing walking over driving decrease by 17\% for work trips and 61\% for nonwork trips. However, transit trips appear to respond to neighborhood crime in a way similar to auto trips; that is, high-crime neighborhoods appear to encourage transit use. The odds of choosing transit over the auto increase by 17\% for work trips and 164\% for nonwork trips. The study found that transit access trips (walking, bicycling, or driving to a transit station) are sensitive to neighborhood crimes in keeping with theoretical expectations: high-crime neighborhoods discourage walking and bicycling and encourage driving to transit stations. Specifically, for transit access to work trips, the odds of choosing to walk or bike to a transit station instead of driving decrease by 48\%.},

The results suggest that the most consequential categories of factors under study are: inappropriate driving speed of automobile; the head-on crash; and night-time trafﬁc in places without streetlights. The cyclists’ faults are of most serious consequence on crossroads when cyclists deny the right of way. Males are more likely to suffer a fatal injury due to a collision with a car than females. The most vulnerable age group are cyclists above 65 years. A fatal injury of a cyclist is more often driver’s fault than cyclist’s (598 vs. 370).},

	abstract = {Background: Bicycling has the potential to improve fitness, diminish obesity, and reduce noise, air pollution, and greenhouse gases associated with travel. However, bicyclists incur a higher risk of injuries requiring hospitalization than motor vehicle occupants. Therefore, understanding ways of making bicycling safer and increasing rates of bicycling are important to improving population health. There is a growing body of research examining transportation infrastructure and the risk of injury to bicyclists.
Methods: We reviewed studies of the impact of transportation infrastructure on bicyclist safety. The results were tabulated within two categories of infrastructure, namely that at intersections (e.g. roundabouts, traffic lights) or between intersections on "straightaways" (e.g. bike lanes or paths). To assess safety, studies examining the following outcomes were included: injuries; injury severity; and crashes (collisions and/or falls).
Results: The literature to date on transportation infrastructure and cyclist safety is limited by the incomplete range of facilities studied and difficulties in controlling for exposure to risk. However, evidence from the 23 papers reviewed (eight that examined intersections and 15 that examined straightaways) suggests that infrastructure influences injury and crash risk. Intersection studies focused mainly on roundabouts. They found that multi-lane roundabouts can significantly increase risk to bicyclists unless a separated cycle track is included in the design. Studies of straightaways grouped facilities into few categories, such that facilities with potentially different risks may have been classified within a single category. Results to date suggest that sidewalks and multi-use trails pose the highest risk, major roads are more hazardous than minor roads, and the presence of bicycle facilities (e.g. on-road bike routes, on-road marked bike lanes, and off-road bike paths) was associated with the lowest risk.
Conclusion: Evidence is beginning to accumulate that purpose-built bicycle-specific facilities reduce crashes and injuries among cyclists, providing the basis for initial transportation engineering guidelines for cyclist safety. Street lighting, paved surfaces, and low-angled grades are additional factors that appear to improve cyclist safety. Future research examining a greater variety of infrastructure would allow development of more detailed guidelines.},

The impacts of physical and environmental factors on the severity of injury to bicyclists are examined. North Carolina Highway Safety Information System crash and inventory data for state-controlled, two-lane, undivided roadways are analyzed. The injury severity distribution, measured on the KABCO scale, is as follows: no injury, 1.8 percent; complaint of pain, 24.4 percent; nonincapacitating injury, 42.5 percent; incapacitating injury, 25.5 percent; and fatal injury, 5.9 percent. The total number of involvements in this data set was 1,025, with a majority of the involvements occurring outside urbanized areas (80.5 percent). Using the ordered probit model, the effect of a set of roadway, environmental, and crash variables on injury severity is explored. Variables that significantly increase injury severity include straight grades, curved grades, darkness, fog, and speed limit. Higher average annual daily traffic, an interaction of speed limit and shoulder-width variables, and dark conditions with street lighting significantly lower injury severity. Separate models are estimated for rural and urban locations. Marginal effects of each factor on the likelihood of each injury-severity class are reported. Policy implications and possible countermeasures are then discussed.},

The characteristics of fatal bicycle accidents are different to those of overall “casualty” accidents. A difference also exists between day and night, and between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan fatal accidents. In the metropolitan area, adult cyclists over 17 years were over-involved in fatal accidents. The proportion of cyclists involved in fatalities at night increases with increase in age. Almost 80\% of nighttime accidents occurred on links on arterial roads, and the majority in the high speed limit zones (75 kph and over). A greater proportion of accidents was initiated by cyclists. In 90\% of nighttime cyclist fatalities the cyclist was hit from the rear, compared with 40\% in daytime.

Two estimators of effect are used, and the results are combined by applying techniques of meta-analysis. Injury accidents are reduced by 50\%. This effect is larger than the effects found in most of the earlier studies. The effect on fatal accidents is slightly larger than the effect on injury accidents. The effect during twilight is about 2/3 of the effect in darkness. The effect of road lighting is signiﬁcantly smaller during adverse weather and road surface conditions than during ﬁne conditions. The effects on pedestrian, bicycle and moped accidents are signiﬁcantly larger than the effects on automobile and motorcycle accidents. The risk of injury accidents was found to increase in darkness. The average increase in risk was estimated to 17\% on lit rural roads and 145\% on unlit rural roads. The average increase in risk during rainy conditions is about 50\% on lit rural roads and about 190\% on unlit rural roads. The average increase in risk with respect to pedestrian accidents is about 140\% on lit rural roads and about 360\% on unlit rural roads.},

Prior research on backover crashes has not assessed the joint effect of heavy vehicles and diminished light conditions on injuries. By analysing the United Kingdom STATS19 crash dataset from 1991 to 2020, this study focused on backover crashes involving paediatric cyclists or pedestrians aged ≤17 years and other motorised vehicles. By estimating the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of multiple logistic regression models, pedestrians appeared to have 82.3\% (95\% CI: 1.78–1.85) higher risks of sustaining killed or serious injuries (KSIs) than cyclists. In addition, casualties involved in backover crashes with heavy vehicles were 39.3\% (95\% CI: 1.35–1.42) more likely to sustain KSIs than those involved in crashes with personal cars. The joint effect of heavy vehicles and diminished light conditions was associated with a 71\% increased probability of sustaining KSIs (AOR = 1.71; 95\% CI: 1.60–1.83). Other signiﬁcant joint effects included young children (aged 0 to 5 years) as pedestrian (AOR = 1.92; 95\% CI: 1.87–1.97), in diminished light conditions (AOR = 1.23; 95\% CI: 1.15–1.31), and with heavy vehicle (AOR = 1.37; 95\% CI: 1.28–1.47).},

	abstract = {Introduction: In recent years, Australia is seeing an increase in the total number of cyclists. However, the rise of serious injuries and fatalities to cyclists has been a major concern. Understanding the factors affecting the fatalities and injuries of bicyclists in crashes with motor vehicles is important to develop effective policy measures aimed at improving the safety of bicyclists. This study aims to identify the factors affecting motor vehicle-bicycle (MVB) crashes in Victoria, Australia and introducing effective countermeasures for the identiﬁed risk factors. Method: A data set of 14,759 MVB crash records from Victoria, Australia between 2006 and 2019 was analyzed using the binary logit model and latent class clustering. Results: It was observed that the factors that increase the risk of fatalities and serious injuries of bicyclists (FSI) in all clusters are: elderly bicyclist, not using a helmet, and darkness condition. Likewise, in areas with no trafﬁc control, clear weather, and dry surface condition (cluster 1), high speed limits increase the risk of FSI, but the occurrence of MVB crashes in cross intersection and T-intersection has been signiﬁcantly associated with a reduction in the risk of FSI. In areas with trafﬁc control and unfavorable weather conditions (cluster 2), wet road surface increases the risk of FSI, but the areas with give way sign and pedestrian crossing signs reduce the risk of FSI. Practical Applications: Recommendations to reduce the risk of fatalities or serious injury to bicyclists are: improvement of road lighting and more exposure of bicyclists using reﬂective clothing and reﬂectors, separation of the bicycle and vehicle path in mid blocks especially in high-speed areas, using a more stable bicycle for the older people, monitoring helmet use, improving autonomous emergency braking, and using bicyclist detection technology for vehicles.},

How to design streets near metro stations to provide a walking/biking friendly built environment is still a key question in promoting the use of metro systems. To identify which general attributes of the street-scale built environment are relevant for pedestrians/cyclists and increase walkability/cycle-ability, this paper reports the results of a stated choice experiment in which eight built environment attributes were systematically varied: street segment length, average number of building floors on both sides of the street, retail shops in frontage of streets, street crossing facilities for pedestrians/ cyclists, width of sidewalks/bicycle paths, greenery, density of street lamps and crowdedness of pedestrian/ cyclists to understand their influence on a road segment choice and preferences. A total of 803 respondents were recruited from Tianjin, China to complete the stated choice experiment through on-street face-to-face interviews. A multinomial logit model was estimated to unravel pedestrian/cyclist preferences using the stated choice data. The results indicate that pedestrians and cyclists have similar preferences for road segments with building lower than 6 floors, 50\% retail shops in frontage, more greenery, lamps between 15 m and 30 m, more crossing facilities, wider sidewalk/bike lane and not crowded. These significant built environment attributes can be used in urban design projects with a walking/biking friendly built environment around a metro station.},

The bicycle routes are identiﬁed using a GPS dataset collected from a smartphone application named “CycleTracks.” The route choice set is generated using the labeling route approach, and the cost functions of route alternatives are based on principal component analyses. Then, two mixed logit models, focusing on random parameters and alternative-speciﬁc coefﬁcients, respectively, are estimated to examine bicyclists’ route choice. The major ﬁndings of this study are as follows: (1) the bicycle route choice involves the joint consideration of convenience, safety, and leisure; (2) most bicyclists prefer to cycle on shorter, ﬂat, and well-planned bicycle facilities with slow road trafﬁc; (3) some bicyclists prefer routes surrounded by mixed land use; (4) some bicyclists favor routes which are planted with street trees or installed with street lights; and (5) some bicyclists prefer routes along with city features. This analysis provides valuable insights into how wellplanned land use and road network can facilitate efﬁcient, safe, and enjoyable bicycling.},

	abstract = {Urban service delivery in cities of Africa is undergoing transformation in the quest to improve access and coverage while reducing the urban infrastructure deficit. This is mainly signaled by the gradual shift to integrated urban planning functions and decision-making spheres within the institutional set-up of city authorities. This paper builds on a triangulated study in Kampala city to argue that urban planning functions should not only be integrated but also responsive to gender needs, as an inclusive pathway to sustained provision of infrastructure. The study found out that the utilization of infrastructure and the associated aspects of service delivery are socially preconditioned by socioeconomic preferences that are based on gender differentials in mobility needs. Women preferred infrastructure that offers personal security, flexible mobility, hygiene and physical comfort, whereas men were primarily concerned about alternative travel routes for punctuality, safety while on the road, convenience and quicker connectivity to public utilities. But planning at city level has neither integrated nor transcended the physical, economic and environmental accounts of infrastructure and service provision to include gender responsiveness. This ultimately leads to delivery outcomes that are less aligned to variations in women’s compared to men’s end-user expectations. The paper concludes with a step-wise framework for conceptualizing how urban planning can be gender responsive together with examples on real-life applications in the context of African cities.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence links the built environment to physical activity levels, health outcomes, and transportation behaviors. However, little of this research has focused on cycling, a sustainable transportation option with great potential for growth in North America. This study examines associations between decisions to bicycle (versus drive) and the built environment, with explicit consideration of three different spatial zones that may be relevant in travel behavior: trip origins, trip destinations, and along the route between. We analyzed 3,280 utilitarian bicycle and car trips in Metro Vancouver, Canada made by 1,902 adults, including both current and potential cyclists. Objective measures were developed for built environment characteristics related to the physical environment, land use patterns, the road network, and bicyclespecific facilities. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the likelihood that a trip was made by bicycle, adjusting for trip distance and personal demographics. Separate models were constructed for each spatial zone, and a global model examined the relative influence of the three zones. In total, 31\% (1,023 out of 3,280) of trips were made by bicycle. Increased odds of bicycling were associated with less hilliness; higher intersection density; less highways and arterials; presence of bicycle signage, traffic calming, and cyclistactivated traffic lights; more neighborhood commercial, educational, and industrial land uses; greater land use mix; and higher population density. Different factors were important within each spatial zone. Overall, the characteristics of routes were more influential than origin or destination characteristics. These findings indicate that the built environment has a significant influence on healthy travel decisions, and spatial context is important. Future research should explicitly consider relevant spatial zones when investigating the relationship between physical activity and urban form.},

The final part of the questionnaire asked about the respondent's personal characteristics: gender, age, reason why they use the bicycle (work, school, leisure, other), frequency of cycling (a few days month, one day a week, two or three days a week, four or more days a week) and if they usually plan their route before leaving home. The results showed that the most important factors were: motor vehicle speed and number of trucks in the flow (both assessed as 5.0 – very important). Other important attributes were: volume of motor vehicles, security and street lighting (all with a 4.86 score). The least important factor was cycling on a one way street (3.29).},

Metro Vancouver, Canada. Subjects. 1402 adult current and potential cyclists, i.e., the ‘‘near market’’ for cycling (representing 31\% of the population). Measures. Preference scores for each infrastructure type (scale from 21, very unlikely to use, to +1, very likely to use); current frequency of use of each infrastructure type (mean number of times/y). Analyses. Descriptive statistics across demographic segments; multiple linear regression.
Results. Most respondents were likely or very likely to choose to cycle on the following broad route categories: off-street paths (71\%–85\% of respondents); physically separated routes next to major roads (71\%); and residential routes (48\%–65\%). Rural roads (21\%–49\%) and routes on major streets (16\%–52\%) were least likely to be chosen. Within the broad categories, routes with traffic calming, bike lanes, paved surfaces, and no on-street parking were preferred, resulting in increases in likelihood of choosing the route from 12\% to 37\%. Findings indicate a marked disparity between preferred cycling infrastructure and the route types that were currently available and commonly used.
Conclusion. This study provides evidence for urban planners about bicycling infrastructure designs that could lead to an increase in active transportation. (Am J Health Promot 2010;25[1]:40–47.)},

	abstract = {Objective: Pedestrian fatalities in the United States increased 51\% from 2009 to 2019. During that time, pedestrian fatalities occurring at night increased by 63.7\%, compared to a 17.6\% increase for pedestrian fatalities occurring during daylight conditions. Have there also been increases in serious, minor, and possible pedestrian injuries (i.e., have all pedestrian collisions been occurring more frequently)? Have pedestrian collisions been getting more severe (i.e., are there now higher proportions of more severe injuries)? Have trends differed between night and day? What role does street lighting play in the nighttime trends?
Methods: We analyzed pedestrian fatalities, serious injuries, minor injuries, and possible injuries that occurred in California, North Carolina, and Texas from 2010 to 2019 using linear regressions to explore the strength and statistical significance of trends. We then parsed these trends by lighting condition, exploring outcomes during the day and night and with and without street lighting.
Results: Findings suggest that increases in daytime minor (7.9\%) and possible (7.5\%) injuries closely mirrored increases in population (9.8\%). Increases in daytime fatal/serious injuries were significantly higher (43.1\% and 35.1\%, respectively), suggesting worsening severities during the day. Increases in nighttime minor/possible injuries (31.9\% and 27.6\%, respectively) were significantly larger than those during the day, suggesting that pedestrian collisions are occurring more frequently at night. Substantial increases in nighttime fatal/serious injuries (78.0\% and 74.7\%, respectively) likely reflect a combination of worsening severity (seen throughout the day) and increasing frequency (seen particularly at night). A pedestrian injured in the dark was found to be 5.0 times more likely to be killed than a pedestrian injured during the day. While a lack of street lighting does not seem to be the cause of the disproportionate increase in pedestrian injuries at night, pedestrians struck without a street light were 2.4 times more likely to be killed than those struck in the presence of a street light.
Conclusions: As we find ourselves in the midst of a pedestrian safety crisis, understanding that severities have increased throughout the entire day and frequencies have increased particularly at night helps illuminate a path forward.},

Method: Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System on pedestrians fatally injured during 2015–2017 were analyzed. Chi-square tests compared characteristics of pedestrians killed on interstates and other freeways with those that died on other roads, and across crash types among freeway deaths. Land use characteristics of locations where pedestrians were killed while crossing freeways in a large state (California) were identiﬁed using Google Earth. Results: A larger proportion of pedestrians killed on freeways died on dark and unlit roads (48\% vs. 32\%), were male (78\% vs. 68\%), or were ages 20–44 (55\% vs. 32\%) compared with pedestrians killed on other roads. Crossing (42\%) was the most common crash type among pedestrian deaths on freeways, followed by disabled-vehicle-related crashes (18\%). Pedestrians who died while crossing more often had blood alcohol concentrations   0.08 g/dL (40\%) than those in disabled-vehicle-related (22\%) or other crashes (34\%). Deaths in crossing crashes were more likely than other freeway deaths to occur on urban roads (81\%), at speed limits  50 mph (13\%), or between 18:00 and 23:59 (49\%), and 58\% of crossing crashes analyzed for land use were located between residential and other (e.g., commercial, recreational) uses. Over a third (37\%) of deaths in disabled-vehicle-related crashes occurred at speed limits  70 mph. Conclusions: A surprising proportion of pedestrian deaths occur on controlled-access roads not designed for walking. Countermeasures for these crashes need to be implemented to see meaningful reductions in pedestrian fatalities overall. Practical applications: Improving roadway and vehicle lighting, requiring reﬂective warning devices for marking disabled vehicles, constructing pedestrian overpasses and underpasses in areas frequently crossed, and promoting alternative means of traveling between residential and commercial areas could help.},

	abstract = {This research explores the factors contributing to the injury severity of bicyclists in bicycle–motor vehicle accidents using a multinomial logit model. The model predicts the probability of four injury severity outcomes: fatal, incapacitating, non-incapacitating, and possible or no injury. The analysis is based on police-reported accident data between 1997 and 2002 from North Carolina, USA. The results show several factors which more than double the probability of a bicyclist suffering a fatal injury in an accident, all other things being kept constant. Notably, inclement weather, darkness with no streetlights, a.m. peak (06:00 a.m. to 09:59 a.m.), head-on collision, speeding-involved, vehicle speeds above 48.3 km/h (30 mph), truck involved, intoxicated driver, bicyclist age 55 or over, and intoxicated bicyclist. The largest effect is caused when estimated vehicle speed prior to impact is greater than 80.5 km/h (50 mph), where the probability of fatal injury increases more than 16-fold. Speed also shows a threshold effect at 32.2 km/h (20 mph), which supports the commonly used 30 km/h speed limit in residential neighborhoods. The results also imply that bicyclist fault is more closely correlated with greater bicyclist injury severity than driver fault.},

	abstract = {Background: Socio-ecological models emphasize the relationship between the physical environment and physical activity (PA). However, knowledge about this relationship in older adults is limited. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the relationship between area of residence (urban, semi-urban or rural) and older adults’ walking and cycling for transportation and recreation. Additionally, relationships between several physical environmental factors and walking and cycling and possible moderating effects of area of residence, age and gender were studied.
Methods: Data from 48,879 Flemish older adults collected in 2004-2010 through peer research were analyzed. Walking, cycling and environmental perceptions were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. The Study Service of the Flemish Government provided objective data on municipal characteristics. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were applied.
Results: Urban participants were more likely to walk daily for transportation compared to rural (OR = 1.43; 95\% CI = 1.22, 1.67) and semi-urban participants (OR = 1.32; 95\% CI = 1.13, 1.54). Urban participants were less likely to cycle daily for transportation compared to semi-urban participants (OR = 0.72; 95\% CI = 0.56, 0.92). Area of residence was unrelated to weekly recreational walking/cycling. Perceived short distances to services (ORs ranging from 1.04 to 1.19) and satisfaction with public transport (ORs ranging from 1.07 to 1.13) were significantly positively related to all walking/cycling behaviors. Feelings of unsafety was negatively related to walking for transportation (OR = 0.93, 95\% CI = 0.91, 0.95) and recreational walking/cycling (OR = 0.95, 95\% CI = 0.92, 0.97). In females, it was also negatively related to cycling for transportation (OR = 0.94, 95\% CI = 0.90, 0.98).
Conclusions: Urban residents were more likely to walk for transportation daily compared to semi-urban and rural residents. Daily cycling for transportation was less prevalent among urban compared to semi-urban residents. Access to destinations appeared to be important for promoting both walking and cycling for transportation and recreation across all demographic subgroups. Additionaly, feelings of unsafety were associated with lower rates of walking for transportation and walking/cycling for recreation in all subgroups and cycling for transportation in females. No clear patterns emerged for other environmental factors.},

Questionnaires were answered by a thousand employees at four major companies in two Swedish cities. There was a clear diﬀerence in mode choice between seasons. The number of car trips increased by 27\% from summer to winter while the number of bicycle trips decreased by 47\%. The number of car trips increased with distance while the number of bicycle trips decreased, and the decrease was even more signiﬁcant in winter than in summer. There was a diﬀerence in opinion between diﬀerent categories of cyclists, on what factors inﬂuenced the choice of transport mode for the journey to work. Temperature, precipitation, and road condition were the most important factors to those who cycled to work in summer but not in winter. Exercise was the most important to those who cycled frequently in winter, and travel time the most important to those who never cycled to work. By improving winter maintenance service levels on cycleways, it might be possible to increase the number of bicycle trips during winter by 18\%, representing a corresponding decrease in the number of car trips of 6\%. To increase cycling during winter, snow clearance was found to be the most important maintenance measure. Skid control was not considered as important for the choice of mode, although important to attend to for safety reasons.},

Although visibility aids have been widely advocated to help prevent bicycle-vehicle conﬂicts, to date no study has investigated, among crash-involved cyclists, the kind of visibility aids they were using at the time of the crash. This study undertook a detailed investigation of visibility factors involved in bicyclist-motor-vehicle crashes. We surveyed 184 bicyclists (predominantly from Australia via internet cycling forums) who had been involved in motor vehicle collisions regarding the perceived cause of the collision, ambient weather and general visibility, as well as the clothing and bicycle lights used by the bicyclist. Over a third of the crashes occurred in low light levels (dawn, dusk or night-time), which is disproportionate given that only a small proportion of bicyclists typically ride at these times. Importantly, 19\% of these bicyclists reported not using bicycle lights at the time of the crash, and only 34\% were wearing reﬂective clothing. Only two participants (of 184) nominated bicyclist visibility as the cause of the crash: 61\% attributed the crash to driver inattention. These ﬁndings demonstrate that crash-involved bicyclists tend to under-rate and under-utilise visibility aids as a means of improving their safety.},

	abstract = {Road safety research in low- and middle-income countries is limited, even though ninety percent of global road traffic fatalities are concentrated in these locations. In Colombia, road traffic injuries are the second leading source of mortality by external causes and constitute a significant public health concern in the city of Bogotá. Bogotá is among the top 10 most bike-friendly cities in the world. However, bicyclists are one of the most vulnerable road-users in the city. Therefore, assessing the pattern of mortality and understanding the variables affecting the outcome of bicyclists’ collisions in Bogotá is crucial to guide policies aimed at improving safety conditions. This study aims to determine the spatiotemporal trends in fatal and nonfatal collision rates and to identify the individual and contextual factors associated with fatal outcomes. We use confidence intervals, geostatistics, and generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) corrected for spatial correlation. The collisions’ records were taken from Bogotá’s Secretariat of Mobility, complemented with records provided by non-governmental organizations (NGO). Our findings indicate that from 2011 to 2017, the fatal bicycling collision rates per bicyclists’ population have remained constant for females while decreasing 53 \% for males. Additionally, we identified high-risk areas located in the west, southwest, and southeast of the city, where the rate of occurrence of fatal events is higher than what occurs in other parts of the city. Finally, our results show associated risk factors that differ by sex. Overall, we find that fatal collisions are positively associated with factors including collisions with large vehicles, the absence of dedicated infrastructure, steep terrain, and nighttime occurrence. Our findings support policy-making and planning efforts to monitor, prioritize, and implement targeted interventions aimed at improving bicycling safety conditions while accounting for gender differences.},

	abstract = {Background: Cycling, as an active mode of transportation, has well-established health beneﬁts. However, the safety of cyclists in trafﬁc remains a major concern. In-depth studies of potential risk factors and safety outcomes are needed to ensure the most appropriate actions are taken to improve safety. However, the lack of reliable exposure data hinders meaningful analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we review the bicycle safety literature reporting different methods for measuring cycling exposure and discuss their ﬁndings.
Methods: A literature search identiﬁed studies on bicycle safety that included a description of how cycling exposure was measured, and what exposure units were used (e.g. distance, time, trips). Results were analyzed based on whether retrospective or prospective measurement of exposure was used, and whether safety outcomes controlled for exposure.
Results: We analyzed 20 papers. Retrospective studies were dominated by major bicycle accidents, whereas the prospective studies included minor and major bicycle accidents. Retrospective studies indicated higher incidence rates (IR) of accidents for men compared to women, and an increased risk of injury for cyclists aged 50 years or older. There was a lack of data for cyclists younger than 18 years. The risk of cycling accidents increased when riding in the dark. Wearing visible clothing or a helmet, or having more cycling experience did not reduce the risk of being involved in an accident. Better cyclist-driver awareness and more interaction between car driver and cyclists, and well maintained bicycle-speciﬁc infrastructure should improve bicycle safety.
Conclusion: The need to include exposure in bicycle safety research is increasingly recognized, but good exposure data are often lacking, which makes results hard to interpret and compare. Studies including exposure often use a retrospective research design, without including data on minor bicycle accidents, making it difﬁcult to compare safety levels between age categories or against different types of infrastructure. Future research should focus more on children and adolescents, as this age group is a vulnerable population and is underrepresented in the existing literature.},

	abstract = {Method: Crash data were extracted from accident reports entered into the Kentucky State Police’s Kentucky Collision Database in 2002–2012. A partial proportional odds model was developed for data analysis.
Results: According to our modeling results, stop-controlled intersections, one-lane approaches, helmet usage, and lower speed limits were associated with decreased injury severity, whereas uncontrolled intersections, older (age {\textgreater} 55) drivers and bicyclists, child (age {\textless} 16) bicyclists, foggy and rainy weather, inadequate use of lights in dark conditions, and wet road surfaces were linked with increased injury severity.
Conclusions: Based on these results, we suggest the development of educational programs focused on the following groups: child bicyclists, older bicyclists, and older drivers. Investigating and modifying street lighting could improve bicycle safety. Implementing road diets/trafﬁc calming methods could create a safer trafﬁc environment. Certain trafﬁc control strategies (e.g., stop control) could be considered for uncontrolled intersections with high bicycle exposure, and helmet campaigns should be launched to increase helmet awareness and use. The study also suggests some interesting future research directions, including examining driver/bicyclist behaviors at uncontrolled intersections and studying the riding behaviors of child bicyclists in Kentucky.},

	abstract = {This paper examines bicyclist, automobile driver, vehicle, environmental, and roadway characteristics that inﬂuence cyclist injury severity in order to determine which factors should be addressed to mitigate the worst bicyclist injuries. An ordered probit model is used to examine single bicycle-single vehicle crashes from Virginia police crash report data from 2010 to 2014. Five injury severity levels are considered: fatalities, severe injuries, minor or possible injuries, no apparent injuries, and no injury. The results of this study most notably found automobile driver intoxication to increase the probability of a cyclist fatality six fold and double the risk of a severe injury, while bicyclist intoxication increases the probability of a fatality by 36.7\% and doubles the probability of severe injury. Additionally, bicycle and automobile speeds, obscured automobile driver vision, speciﬁc vehicle body types (SUV, truck, and van), vertical roadway grades and horizontal curves elevate the probability of more severe bicyclist injuries. Model results encourage consideration of methods to reduce the impact of biking and driving while intoxicated such as analysis of bicycling under the inﬂuence laws, education of drunk driving impacts on bicyclists, and separation of vehicles and bicycles on the road. Additionally, the results encourage consideration of methods to improve visibility of bicyclists and expectation of their presence on the road.},

Methods: We reviewed studies that addressed the following environmental and policy strategies to promote physical activity: community-scale urban design and land use policies and practices to increase physical activity; street-scale urban design and land use policies to increase physical activity; and transportation and travel policies and practices. These systematic reviews were based on the methods of the independent Task Force on Community Preventive Services. Exposure variables were classified according to the types of infrastructures/policies present in each study. Measures of physical activity behavior were used to assess effectiveness. Results: Two interventions were effective in promoting physical activity (community-scale and street-scale urban design and land use policies and practices). Additional information about applicability, other effects, and barriers to implementation are provided for these interventions. Evidence is insufficient to assess transportation policy and practices to promote physical activity. Conclusions: Because community- and street-scale urban design and land-use policies and practices met the Community Guide criteria for being effective physical activity interventions, implementing these policies and practices at the community-level should be a priority of public health practitioners and community decision makers.},

This study compares the eﬀects of three diﬀerent lighting scenarios (conventional lighting, state-of-the-art LED, optimized LED) on road users via surveys (N = 598 persons) and observations (N = 1341 persons) in the city of Vienna. In terms of the uniformity of street illumination and the comfort it provides, the results show the positive eﬀects of LED street lighting both on surveyed pedestrians and vehicle drivers. The observations of pedestrian walking behavior revealed an unexpected result—no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were noted apart from a more centric walking path along the sidewalk under LED illumination, particularly with the optimized LED luminaire.},

	abstract = {Background: Many youth today are physically inactive. Recent attention linking the physical or built environment to physical activity in adults suggests an investigation into the relationship between the built environment and physical activity in children could guide appropriate intervention strategies.
Method: Thirty three quantitative studies that assessed associations between the physical environment (perceived or objectively measured) and physical activity among children (ages 3 to 18-years) and fulfilled selection criteria were reviewed. Findings were categorized and discussed according to three dimensions of the physical environment including recreational infrastructure, transport infrastructure, and local conditions.
Results: Results across the various studies showed that children's participation in physical activity is positively associated with publicly provided recreational infrastructure (access to recreational facilities and schools) and transport infrastructure (presence of sidewalks and controlled intersections, access to destinations and public transportation). At the same time, transport infrastructure (number of roads to cross and traffic density/speed) and local conditions (crime, area deprivation) are negatively associated with children's participation in physical activity.
Conclusion: Results highlight links between the physical environment and children's physical activity. Additional research using a transdisciplinary approach and assessing moderating and mediating variables is necessary to appropriately inform policy efforts.},

	abstract = {Background:  Children’s independent mobility (CIM) is an important contributor to physical activity and health in children. However, in the last 20 years CIM has significantly decreased. To develop effective intervention programs to promote CIM, the impact of the environment on CIM must be identified. This review seeks to provide an overview of sex/gender-specific socio-ecological correlates of CIM.
Methods:  A systematic literature search of five databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, Medline, Web of Science) was conducted with a priori defined eligibility criteria and identified 1838 potential articles published between January 1990 and November 2017. Two independent reviewers screened the literature and identified and rated methodological quality of the studies. Related factors of CIM were summarized separately for CIM license (parental permission to travel independently) and CIM destination (destinations to which a child travels independently), and separately for boys and girls using a semi-quantitative method.
Results:  Twenty-seven peer-reviewed journal articles were identified which examined the relationship between the social and physical environment and CIM. Only seven studies reported results divided by sex/gender. Most associations between the environment and CIM were found in the expected direction (positive or negative) or not associated at all. The social environment seemed to be more influential for ensuring CIM than the physical environment. Neighborhood safety, fear of crime and stranger, parental support, and perception of traffic were important social environmental factors influencing CIM, while car ownership, distance, and neighborhood design were relevant physical environmental attributes. Few studies examined sex/gender-related environmental correlates of independent mobility, and those findings were inconsistent.
Conclusion:  The findings of this systematic review serve as suggestions for intervention programs to increase CIM and to identify future directions in research. To establish a robust comprehension of the impact of the social and physical environment on CIM, further sex/gender-sensitive studies using comparable measurements for CIM and environmental correlates are needed.},

This review presents (1) prevalence estimates for active commuting to school; (2) the correlates of active commuting to school, presented using a new conceptual framework; (3) the associations between active commuting to school and health (ie, physical activity, weight status, environmental); and (4) a summary of the findings and recommendations for further research. Considerable heterogeneity exists among the reviewed studies for sample size and demographics, the methods used to measure active commuting, and the definition used to identify a positive case (active commuter). In general, active commuting to school is much less prevalent in the United States compared with European countries. A wide range of correlates of active commuting to school have been studied (individual to policy level). Active commuters tend to be more active than nonactive commuters, although no difference in weight status was observed in most studies. More research is needed to corroborate these findings and build on the knowledge base so that effective walk-to-school interventions can be implemented independently or as part of other health promotion efforts, including physician counseling for physical activity.},

	abstract = {Background: Emerging frameworks to examine active school transportation (AST) commonly emphasize the built environment (BE) as having an influence on travel mode decisions. Objective measures of BE attributes have been recommended for advancing knowledge about the influence of the BE on school travel mode choice. An updated systematic review on the relationships between GIS-measured BE attributes and AST is required to inform future research in this area. The objectives of this review are: i) to examine and summarize the relationships between objectively measured BE features and AST in children and adolescents and ii) to critically discuss GIS methodologies used in this context.
Methods: Six electronic databases, and websites were systematically searched, and reference lists were searched and screened to identify studies examining AST in students aged five to 18 and reporting GIS as an environmental measurement tool. Fourteen cross-sectional studies were identified. The analyses were classified in terms of density, diversity, and design and further differentiated by the measures used or environmental condition examined.
Results: Only distance was consistently found to be negatively associated with AST. Consistent findings of positive or negative associations were not found for land use mix, residential density, and intersection density. Potential modifiers of any relationship between these attributes and AST included age, school travel mode, route direction (e.g., to/from school), and trip-end (home or school). Methodological limitations included inconsistencies in geocoding, selection of study sites, buffer methods and the shape of zones (Modifiable Areal Unit Problem [MAUP]), the quality of road and pedestrian infrastructure data, and school route estimation.
Conclusions: The inconsistent use of spatial concepts limits the ability to draw conclusions about the relationship between objectively measured environmental attributes and AST. Future research should explore standardizing buffer size, assess the quality of street network datasets and, if necessary, customize existing datasets, and explore further attributes linked to safety.},

	abstract = {Background: Preliminary evidence suggests that the physical environment and transportation are associated with youth physical activity levels. Only a few studies have examined the association of physical environmental factors on walking and bicycling to school. Therefore, the purpose of this study was (1) to examine the test-retest reliability of a survey designed for youth to assess perceptions of physical environmental factors (e.g. safety, aesthetics, facilities near the home) and transportation, and (2) to describe the associations of these perceptions with both physical activity and active transport to school.
Methods: Test and retest surveys, administered a median of 12 days later, were conducted with 480 sixth- and eighthgrade girls in or near six U.S. communities. The instrument consisted of 24 questions on safety and aesthetics of the perceived environment and transportation and related facilities. Additionally, girls were asked if they were aware of 14 different recreational facilities offering structured and unstructured activities, and if so, whether they would visit these facilities and the ease with which they could access them. Test-retest reliability was determined using kappa coefficients, overall and separately by grade. Associations with physical activity and active transport to school were examined using mixed model logistic regression (n = 610), adjusting for grade, race/ethnicity, and site.
Results: Item-specific reliabilities for questions assessing perceived safety and aesthetics of the neighborhood ranged from 0.31 to 0.52. Reliabilities of items assessing awareness of and interest in going to the 14 recreational facilities ranged from 0.47 to 0.64. Reliabilities of items assessing transportation ranged from 0.34 to 0.58. Some items on girls' perceptions of perceived safety, aesthetics of the environment, facilities, and transportation were important correlates of physical activity and, in some cases, active transport to school.
Conclusion: This study provides some psychometric support for the use of the questionnaire on physical environmental factors and transportation for studying physical activity and active transport to school among adolescent girls. Further},

	abstract = {Background: Despite related physical/mental health beneﬁts, children0s independent mobility for school travel (i.e. walking/cycling without adult accompaniment) has declined in recent decades.
Purpose: To examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between social/physical environmental variables and independent mobility on the school journey.
Methods: Participants were 1121 9–10 year-olds residing within 1600 m of their school in urban/rural areas of Norfolk, UK in 2007 (T1). At one year (T2) 491 children were followed-up. At T1, parents surveyreported perceptions of the social/physical environment and rules regarding their child0s physical activity. Characteristics of the neighborhood, route to school and school environment were measured using a Geographical Information System and school audits. At both time-points children surveyreported their usual travel mode and whether accompanied. Regression analyses were conducted in 2013.
Results: Around half walked/cycled to school without adult accompaniment (T1, 43\%; T2, 53\%). Parents often allowing their child to play outside anywhere within the neighborhood (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.14 (95\% CI 1.24–7.96)) and household car access (AOR 0.27 (95\% CI 0.08–0.94)) were associated longitudinally with boys walking/cycling independently to school. Land use mix (AOR 1.38 (95\% CI 1.06–1.79)), proportion of main roads in the neighborhood (AOR 0.67 (95\% CI 0.47–0.94)) and parental encouragement for walking/cycling (AOR 0.40 (95\% CI 0.20–0.80)) were associated longitudinally with girls walking/cycling independently to school.
Conclusions: Interventions should develop parents0 skills to teach their children to be independently mobile and to build conﬁdence regarding venturing out without parental accompaniment. Urban planners should consider designing neighborhoods in which residences, business/retail outlets and sports facilities are co-located to promote active transport.},

Purpose: This study aims to assess whether objectively measured characteristics of the neighborhood, route, and school environments are associated with active commuting to school among children, and it explores whether distance acts as a moderator in this association.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 2012 children (899 boys and 1113 girls) aged 9 –10 years attending 92 schools in the county of Norfolk, United Kingdom. Questionnaires were completed by children and parents during Summer 2007. Attributes around the home and children’s route to school were assessed using a GIS. School environments were assessed using a newly developed school audit and via questionnaires completed by head teachers. Data were analyzed in 2008.
Results: Almost half of the children usually walked or cycled to school. Children who lived in a more deprived area and whose route to school was direct were less likely to walk or cycle to school, whereas those who had a higher density of roads in their neighborhood were more likely to walk. Further, children whose routes had a high density of streetlights were less likely to cycle to school. Distance did not moderate the observed associations.
Conclusions: Objectively measured neighborhood and route factors are associated with walking and cycling to school. However, distance did not moderate the associations found here. Creating safe environments by improving urban design may influence children’s commuting behavior. Intervention studies are needed to confırm the fındings from this observational cross-sectional study.},

	abstract = {An ordered-response model is used in this research to evaluate the factors that affect frequency of bicycle use for a person's commute to and from work. Data used were gathered during an original survey effort conducted over the Internet in 2002. Empirical results are presented, and policy implications of these results for urban planning are discussed. In addition, deterrents and facilitators of bicycle commuting as reported by respondents in the survey are descriptively analyzed. Several findings from this research contribute to the state of the knowledge in bicycle commuting. First, the availability of showers or clothing lockers at the work place does not appear to inspire bicycle commuters to commute by bicycle more frequently. Second, using a bicycle for nonwork trip purposes increases an individual's frequency of commuting by bicycle to work. Other important results indicate that nonbicycle commuters either have misconceptions about the dangers of bicycling or else they lack convenient, safe route options for bicycling to work. Practitioners can use the ordered-response model to estimate an individual bicycle commuter's frequency of commuting by bicycle. The results can also help practitioners estimate the effects on nonmotorized mode share of programs that compete for funds to provide bicycling safety education, bicycle parking, and promotion of bicycling.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns road lighting for pedestrians and how this aids reassurance, their confidence when walking alone after dark. Evidence from past studies that lighting enhances reassurance is supported by the findings of an unfocussed approach that aimed deliberately to avoid focus on lighting or fear, thus to counter the unintended potential for focussed, quantitative methods to lead towards such a finding. Review of the characteristics of lighting suggests an optimum illuminance of 10 lux, of high S/P ratio, and aimed toward the pedestrian and natural elements of the environment, will enhance reassurance. Further research is needed to validate the optimum illuminance, the appropriate metric for characterising lamp spectral power distribution, and the most desirable aims of spatial distribution.},

	abstract = {This article discusses lighting for pedestrians and how investigation of reassurance might lead toward an understanding of the right amount of light. A conventional approach is to evaluate reassurance after dark under road lighting of different illuminance: this tends to show the trivial result that higher illuminances enhance reassurance, and that alone does not enable an optimum light level to be identiﬁed. One reason is that the category rating procedure widely used is prone to stimulus range bias; experimental results are presented that demonstrate stimulus range bias in reassurance evaluations. This article also recommends alternative methods for future research. One such method is the day–dark rating approach, which does not tend toward ever higher illuminances, and results are presented of two studies using this method.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the ﬁrst route choice model for bicyclists estimated from a large sample of GPS observations and overcomes the limitations inherent in the generally employed stated preference approach. It employs an improved mode detection algorithm for GPS post-processing to determine trips made by bicycle, which are map matched to an enriched street network. The alternatives are generated as a random sample from an exhaustive, but constrained search. Accounting for the similarity between the alternatives with the pathsize factor the MNL estimates show that the elasticity with regards to trip length is nearly four times larger than that with respect to the share of bike paths. The elasticity with respect to the product of length and maximum gradient of the route is small. No other variable describing the routes had an impact. The heterogeneity of the cyclists is captured through interaction terms formulated on their average behaviour.},

	abstract = {Presented here are findings from a recent study on roadway design preferences of pedestrians, drivers, bicyclists, and public transit users along a major urban corridor in the east San Francisco Bay Area in California. Sponsored by the California Department of Transportation, the research focused on exploring design preferences that could increase perceived traffic safety, walkability, bikeability, and economic vitality along urban arterials. Results from an intercept survey showed that all user groups desired similar roadway design features along the test corridor, which carried 25,000 to 30,000 motorists bidirectionally and had comprehensive sidewalk coverage but no bicycle facilities. In an open-ended question about street improvements to enhance perceived traffic safety, all respondent groups requested the same top five improvements. Bicycle lanes were ranked first by pedestrians, drivers, and bicyclists (fifth by public transit respondents) and improved pedestrian crossings were ranked second by pedestrians, drivers, and public transit users (third by bicyclists). The other top five suggestions were the same for all groups though ordered slightly differently: slowing traffic and improving driver behavior, increasing street lighting, and increasing traffic signals and stop signs. Similar preference alignment was found for street improvements to encourage more visits to the corridor. These findings suggest that design features generally thought to benefit one road user group, such as bicycle lanes for bicyclists, may also benefit other users. Moreover, these results provide evidence that roadway planning can take advantage of synergistic opportunities to benefit multiple user groups by implementing a few key design interventions. Overall, the findings support the continued implementation of complete streets principles and policies.},
