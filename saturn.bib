	abstract = {Road crashes in metropolitan areas are challenging to prevent because they stem from the interactions of drivers and other system users in intricate built environments. Recent theories indicate that features of the built environment may induce unsafe driving by shaping users’ expectations and behaviors. The availability of street view imagery and methods of scene parsing create new possibilities for understanding how features of the built environment inﬂuence crash incidence. Most previous crash research using street imagery has applied manual processing methods. In this paper, we develop and apply automated machine parsed imagery in conjunction with self-explaining roads theory to consider how the street space visible to drivers inﬂuences crash frequency, using data from Columbus, Ohio, USA. While controlling for road network and area characteristics, we model the association of individual street elements with crash frequency. We then conduct a cluster analysis to deﬁne four types of street spaces, which are used in a subsequent model. We ﬁnd that an Open Road type of metropolitan street space, characterized by more visible sky, roadway, and signage are associated with the greatest increase in crashes, and that the majority of these spaces exist on arterial or collector class road segments. We theorize that the visual similarity of this type of street space to highways promotes faster, less careful driving, which combines with their mixed land uses to make them the least safe. This points to the importance of trafﬁc calming for such roads in high-activity areas, and the need to differentiate environments of non-highways from highways to promote careful driving.},

Traditional methods of data collection are expensive, time consuming, and lack spatial and temporal detail. New sources have emerged as a result of crowdsourced data from ﬁtness apps, allowing cyclists to track routes using GPS enabled cell phones. Our goal is to determine if crowdsourced data from ﬁtness apps data can be used to quantify and map the spatial and temporal variation of ridership. Using data provided by Strava.com, we quantify how well crowdsourced ﬁtness app data represent ridership through comparison with manual cycling counts in Victoria, British Columbia. Comparisons are made for hourly, AM and PM peak, and peak period totals that are separated by season. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a Generalized Linear Model we modelled the relationships between crowdsourced data from Strava and manual counts and predicted categories of ridership into low, medium, and high for all roadways in Victoria. Our results indicate a linear association (r2 0.40 to 0.58) between crowdsourced data volumes and manual counts, with one crowdsourced data cyclist representing 51 riders. Categorical cycling volumes were predicted and mapped using data on slope, trafﬁc speeds, on street parking, time of year, and crowdsourced ridership with a predictive accuracy of 62\%. Crowdsourced ﬁtness data are a biased sample of ridership, however, in urban areas the high temporal and spatial resolution of data can predict categories of ridership and map spatial variation. Crowdsourced ﬁtness apps offer a new source of data for transportation planning and can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of ofﬁcial count programs.},

	abstract = {Cycling has a range of benefits as is recognised by national and international policies aiming to increase cycling rates. Darkness acts as a barrier to people cycling, with fewer people cycling after-dark when seasonal and time-of-day factors are accounted for. This paper explores whether road lighting can reduce the negative impact of darkness on cycling rates. Changes in cycling rates between daylight and after-dark were quantified for 48 locations in Birmingham, United Kingdom, by calculating an odds ratio. These odds ratios were compared against two measures of road lighting at each location: 1) Density of road lighting lanterns; 2) Relative brightness as estimated from night-time aerial images. Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased. These results suggest only a minimal amount of lighting can promote cycling after-dark, making it an attractive mode of transport year-round.},

An alternative approach is to use objective data, specifically the number of pedestrians and cyclists present under different lighting conditions. Such data have been reported previously using a daylight savings transition approach. This paper presents a different method for analysing the effect of ambient light conditions in which data from the whole year are examined, rather than only the two weeks either side of the biannual daylight savings clock changes. The results confirm that ambient light has a significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when they are unlit. While both methods use an odds ratio approach, which should account for environmental changes other than lighting, the results suggest the daylight savings method of analysis better isolates changes in weather from the effects of ambient light on travel choice than does the whole-year method.},

The data analysed were the height at which a rising obstacle was detected, this simulating an approaching irregularity in the road surface. The results suggest that when cycling on a lit road, cycle lighting frequently offers no benefit for peripheral detection and may make it worse. It was demonstrated that position matters: At low illuminances, a hub-mounted lamp improved detection over a handlebar-mounted lamp. This benefit was sufficient to offset the reduction in detection found when decreasing road lighting from 2.0 lux to 0.2 lux.},

One reason for this is the perceived danger of cycling on roads filled with traffic. There is statistical evidence to support this perception; for equal exposure, cyclists are more likely to be seriously injured than either drivers or pedestrians. Lighting has a role to play in reducing the hazards of cycling by enhancing the visibility and conspicuity of cyclists. Unfortunately, it is not at all clear that the current lighting regulations and recommendations for cycling and cyclists are the best that can be achieved or are even adequate for these purposes. A number of actions are suggested that should enable lighting’s contribution to the safety of cyclists to be realized.},

Results of the previous analysis were reproduced in terms of the direction of the effect, but the repeated analysis found greater differences between daylight and darkness.

Identifying the barriers and enablers to riding a bike for transport is essential to developing interventions that encourage bike riding.

A systematic database search was conducted to identify relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature. Fourty-ﬁve papers/reports met eligibility criteria. There were 34 barriers and 21 enablers identiﬁed. The leading barriers related to riding on the road alongside motor vehicles. Other factors identiﬁed included the provision and quality of cycling infrastructure, personal factors such as physical ﬁtness, attitudinal factors such as community perceptions of cyclists, and environmental factors. While this review highlights the complexity of factors that inﬂuence the uptake of riding a bike for transport, many of the leading factors could be overcome through the provision of high-quality protected infrastructure for bike riders. Other interventions to address other known barriers and enablers are needed to increase the uptake of bike riding.},

Most studies focus on bicycle parking at public transport stops and at work places. Few studies report on bicycle parking throughout cities, and hardly any on parking at residential locations. Bicycle parking supply and quality appears to be a determinant of cycling for current and potential cyclists. Our ﬁndings can serve as input for an evidence-based debate on the role of bicycle parking. For practitioners, our research supports investment in bicycle parking, but acknowledges that a proper evaluation of such initiatives needs to be conducted to increase the level of evidence.},

A web-based survey was conducted to understand the travel patterns and the specific issues regarding bicyclists. The survey included questions about possible bicycle infrastructure improvements, policy, and program innovations to assess the perceptions of the campus community regarding these changes. The findings of this survey, conducted to understand cyclists’ travel patterns and identify their issues and concerns, are discussed. Both nonbicycle commuters and bicycle commuters agreed that bicycle lanes, trails, and paths would encourage them to ride a bike (or ride more often) to the campus. Discrete choice models are estimated to model the commuters’ mode to campus. The findings of the models suggest that people are more sensitive to time for nonmotorized modes and women are less likely to ride a bicycle. Those who perceive walking and biking as a form of exercise and identify flexibility of departure time as an important factor in their mode choice are more likely to ride a bicycle. Those more likely to choose to drive an automobile to campus assume that they do not have other options to commute to campus. Policies designed to promote the use of bicycle transportation on and to the campus based on these findings are presented. The results of this study will help practitioners and campus transportation planners understand the reasons that prevent people from bicycling and evaluate the transportation improvements that may be considered to achieve bicycle-friendly campuses.},

To investigate gender equity, we develop a bivariate statistical analysis along with a twolevel nested logit model. The results of the bivariate statistical analysis indicate females are about 30\% less likely to bicycle from home to campus and are signiﬁcantly more sensitive to environmental and infrastructural conditions. Complementary to the bivariate statistical analysis, the results of the two-level nested logit model demonstrate that distant trips, longer travel times, not having access to a bicycle, and an unsafe environment avert females from bicycling. We also ﬁnd that undergraduate females are less likely to bike to campus than other group of students. The ﬁndings highlight that the integration of bicycle and transit services, advancing infrastructure to separate bicycle from motorized traﬃc, improving safety in bicycle facilities, and enhancing public knowledge about local bicycle routes promote bicycling among females.},

	abstract = {This paper contributes to debates on gender, mobility and planning through an analysis of Cycling Level of Service tools (CLoS). Whilst many UK cities have had some success increasing overall cycling numbers in recent years, women are still far less likely to cycle, often because of concerns with journey quality related to traﬃc safety and social safety. CLoS tools are used by planners and engineers to assess existing routes and ensure they are safe, direct and continuous. However, whilst CLoS tools are seen to provide objective measures of some principles, we argue that they fail to attribute enough importance to gendered diﬀerences in perceptions of social safety. Based upon qualitative go-along and interview data, we assess the Welsh CLoS tool, demonstrating that it allows routes considered to be unrideable by female cyclists to be designated as rideable because there is no requirement to take mandatory remedial action regarding what are shown to be critically low scores on indicators of social safety. Whilst larger studies are required to validate these ﬁndings, our data suggests that the safety component of the CLoS tool can only be considered objective from a male point of view and inadequately considers the perspectives and needs of women. Moreover, we argue that in mandating socially unsafe routes as safe, CLoS actively reproduces gendered ‘essences’ such as vulnerability. As a result we suggest that CLoS urgently needs to be incorporated into gender and equalities audits if it is to accurately reﬂect the needs of more diverse user groups.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A promising way to stimulate physical activity is to promote the choice for active modes of transport (walking and cycling). Over the past years, several interventions and policies have been implemented to stimulate this mode shift. However, information concerning the effectiveness of these interventions and policies is still limited. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the effectiveness of interventions designed to stimulate a shift from car use to cycling or walking and to obtain insight into the intervention tools that have been used to promote and/or implement these interventions.
Methods: Five databases were searched and articles published in English, Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish were included. Only studies that focussed on a mode shift from car use towards active transport in a general adult population, which were published in peer reviewed journals and which investigated effectiveness were included. Intervention tools used were categorized by using the model of Hoogerwerf \& Herweijer, as either legal, economic (subsidy, reward system, penalty), communicative (written materials, behavioural tools) and physical tools (providing bicycles, providing better bicycle facilities at work, adjustment of the environment).
Results: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Studies included described workplace-based interventions, architectural and urbanistic adjustments, population-wide interventions, and bicycle-renting systems. Nearly all studies (except three) showed positive effects concerning a mode shift. Most of the included studies used more than one intervention tool and the tools used differed between types of interventions. However, information about the statistical signiﬁcance of these results was often lacking and the study methodologies used were not of high quality.
Conclusion: Nearly all studies showed results in a positive direction. However, the quality of the included studies was mostly low and intervention characteristics were poorly described. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Previous research has investigated mode choice, travel destination, and other travel choices for 1 day only. However, it cannot be assumed that travel choices do not vary from day to day and that most individuals travel by the same transportation mode every day. Day-to-day decisions to cycle are affected by work characteristics, commute journey characteristics, and weather conditions. More specifically, workers wearing business attire, needing to transport goods, needing a car during office hours, having longer commute distances, commuting in the dark, and facing a higher wind speed or a more or longer duration of rain are less likely to commute by bicycle. Positive effects were found for temperature and the duration of sunshine. The results show that factors that can differ on a daily basis largely influence bicycle mode choice from day to day. The results show that two groups of part-time cyclists exist: occasional cyclists and frequent cyclists. Whereas the decisions of occasional cyclists to commute by bicycle are more affected by positive weather conditions, frequent cyclists are discouraged from cycling by more practical barriers, including wind speed and the need to be at multiple locations.},

We systematically reviewed the literature on neighbourhood physical environmental correlates of AT in older adults and applied a novel meta-analytic approach to statistically quantify the strength of evidence for environment-AT associations.
Methods: Forty two quantitative studies that estimated associations of aspects of the neighbourhood built environment with AT in older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) and met selection criteria were reviewed and meta-analysed. Findings were analysed according to five AT outcomes (total walking for transport, within-neighbourhood walking for transport, combined walking and cycling for transport, cycling for transport, and all AT outcomes combined) and seven categories of the neighbourhood physical environment (residential density/urbanisation, walkability, street connectivity, access to/availability of services/destinations, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, aesthetics and cleanliness/order, and safety and traffic).
Results: Most studies examined correlates of total walking for transport. A sufficient amount of evidence of positive associations with total walking for transport was found for residential density/urbanisation, walkability, street connectivity, overall access to destinations/services, land use mix, pedestrian-friendly features and access to several types of destinations. Littering/vandalism/decay was negatively related to total walking for transport. Limited evidence was available on correlates of cycling and combined walking and cycling for transport, while sufficient evidence emerged for a positive association of within-neighbourhood walking with pedestrian-friendly features and availability of benches/sitting facilities. Correlates of all AT combined mirrored those of walking for transport. Positive associations were also observed with food outlets, business/institutional/industrial destinations, availability of street lights, easy access to building entrance and human and motorised traffic volume. Several but inconsistent individual- and environmental-level moderators of associations were identified.
Conclusions: Results support strong links between the neighbourhood physical environment and older adults’ AT. Future research should focus on the identification of types and mixes of destinations that support AT in older adults and how these interact with individual characteristics and other environmental factors. Future research should also aim to clarify dose-response relationships through multi-country investigations and data-pooling from diverse geographical regions.},

	abstract = {Background: Empirical evidence suggests that an association between the built environment and physical activity exists. This evidence is mostly derived from cross-sectional studies that do not account for other causal explanations such as neighborhood self-selection. Experimental and quasi-experimental designs can be used to isolate the effect of the built environment on physical activity, but in their absence, statistical techniques that adjust for neighborhood self-selection can be used with cross-sectional data. Previous reviews examining the built environment-physical activity relationship have not differentiated among findings based on study design. To deal with self-selection, we synthesized evidence regarding the relationship between objective measures of the built environment and physical activity by including in our review: 1) cross-sectional studies that adjust for neighborhood self-selection and 2) quasi-experiments.Method: In September 2010, we searched for English-language studies on built environments and physical activity from all available years in health, leisure, transportation, social sciences, and geographical databases. Twenty cross-sectional and 13 quasi-experimental studies published between 1996 and 2010 were included in the review.Results: Most associations between the built environment and physical activity were in the expected direction or null. Land use mix, connectivity and population density and overall neighborhood design were however, important determinants of physical activity. The built environment was more likely to be associated with transportation walking compared with other types of physical activity including recreational walking. Three studies found an attenuation in associations between built environment characteristics and physical activity after accounting for neighborhood self-selection.Conclusion: More quasi-experiments that examine a broader range of environmental attributes in relation to context-specific physical activity and that measure changes in the built environment, neighborhood preferences and their effect on physical activity are needed. © 2011 McCormack and Shiell; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction: We describe and analyse a new, open dataset of surveyed cycling infrastructure in London UK. We demonstrate its potential to contribute to research and evidence-based policy development through a spatial analysis of infrastructure provision in London, before evaluating administrative boroughs on their infrastructure mix and compliance with UK Cycle Infrastructure Design Standards.
Methods: We processed and cleaned the 233,596 records in the London Cycling Infrastructure Database (CID) that contains nine infrastructure types. To support comparison between London boroughs, infrastructure provision was normalised to borough area, population size and level of commuter cycling. We generated variables capturing cyclist separation from motor vehicles and estimated cycle lane compliance for such segregation against design standards.
Results: Each CID record contains the infrastructure survey date, spatial location, infrastructurespecific variables and accompanying photographs. Traffic calming assets are numerous and distributed throughout London. Cyclist signals, crossings, Advanced Stop Lanes and cycle lanes and tracks are less numerous and more commonly seen in inner rather than outer London. Normalisation by area and population did not change these spatial patterns. Six percent of onroad cycle lane length is physically segregated from vehicles. Estimated compliance with UK design standards was notably higher for inner London boroughs with 66\% exceeding mean compliance compared to just 24\% of outer London boroughs.
Conclusions: In this first systematic description and analysis of the CID we have demonstrated its potential to quantitively and qualitatively compare infrastructure and a method to estimate compliance against design standards. We found that cycling infrastructure is not distributed equally across London and may not be of the quality that provides safe space for cycling. Such datasets are critical assets to evaluate infrastructure and guide health and transport policies.},

Personal safety is commonly cited in qualitative research as a barrier to local walking, yet the relationship between safety and constrained physical activity has received mixed support in quantitative studies. This paper reviews the quantitative evidence to date, seeking to explain the inconsistencies, and offers recommendations for future research.
Methods. A social–ecological framework was adopted to explore the evidence linking crime-related safety, and factors that inﬂuence real and perceived safety, with constrained physical activity.
Results. Perceived safety tends to affect the physical activity of groups already known to exhibit greater anxiety about crime; and some elements of the built environment that inﬂuence safety appear to constrain physical activity. However the evidence is somewhat inconsistent, and this may be partly attributed to measurement limitations. Many studies employ generic safety measures that make implicit references to crime or use composite variables that lack speciﬁcity. Physical activity outcomes also require consideration, as only activities occurring locally outdoors are likely to be affected by neighborhood crime.
Conclusions. Further research is required to tease out associations between real and perceived crimerelated safety and physical activity, ideally employing behaviour and crime-speciﬁc measures, and addressing the moderating role of the social and built environments.},

This paper examines if neighbourhood environments are associated with physical activity, especially walking and cycling. It analyses 608 respondent survey data from Washington State in the US and Geographic Information System-derived measures of the neighbourhood environment. Respondents reported trafﬁc volume to be the most signiﬁcant barrier, and good lighting to be the most important facilitator of walking and cycling. Utilitarian destinations, such as grocery stores, restaurants, retail stores and convenience stores, were signiﬁcant correlates of walking and moderate-intensity physical activities, while housing type, sports facility and transportation infrastructure were correlated with vigorous physical activities. Active people rated higher for their neighbourhood attributes including safety, visual quality, knowing neighbours, seeing many other people walking and cycling, and the availability of sports facilities, parks, and bike racks. Simple interventions such as street lighting, pavements/sidewalks, street trees, benches, bike lanes or trails, bike racks, and trafﬁc-calming devices appeared to hold some promise in promoting physical activities in neighbourhoods. Long-term solutions should include strategies to enhance overall aesthetics, safety, accessibility, street connectivity, and social interactions among neighbours.},

Furthermore, it was revealed that on-street parking, garbage bins, and streetlights could inﬂuence the pedestrians to select longer distance routes. In addition, pedestrians were more likely to select the shortest distance route when they were engaged in leisure activities with an accompanist. The ﬁndings of this study would offer insights, from different perspectives, into the micro-scale street environment and the walking behavior of pedestrians.},

	abstract = {The lack of physical activity has become a rigorous challenge for many countries, and the relationship between physical activity and the built environment has become a hot research topic in recent decades. This study uses the Strava Heatmap (novel crowdsourced data) to extract the distribution of cycling and running tracks in central Chengdu in December 2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and develops spatial regression models for numerous 500 × 500 m grids (N = 2,788) to assess the impacts of the built environment on the cycling and running intensity indices. The ﬁndings are summarized as follows. First, land-use mix has insigniﬁcant effects on the physical activity of residents, which largely contrasts with the evidence gathered from previous studies. Second, road density, water area, green space area, number of stadiums, and number of enterprises signiﬁcantly facilitate cycling and running. Third, river line length and the light index have positive associations with running but not with cycling. Fourth, housing price is positively correlated with cycling and running. Fifth, schools seem to discourage these two types of physical activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides practical implications (e.g., green space planning and public space management) for urban planners, practitioners, and policymakers.},

	abstract = {Objective: Pedestrian fatalities in the United States increased 51\% from 2009 to 2019. During that time, pedestrian fatalities occurring at night increased by 63.7\%, compared to a 17.6\% increase for pedestrian fatalities occurring during daylight conditions. Have there also been increases in serious, minor, and possible pedestrian injuries (i.e., have all pedestrian collisions been occurring more frequently)? Have pedestrian collisions been getting more severe (i.e., are there now higher proportions of more severe injuries)? Have trends differed between night and day? What role does street lighting play in the nighttime trends?
Methods: We analyzed pedestrian fatalities, serious injuries, minor injuries, and possible injuries that occurred in California, North Carolina, and Texas from 2010 to 2019 using linear regressions to explore the strength and statistical significance of trends. We then parsed these trends by lighting condition, exploring outcomes during the day and night and with and without street lighting.
Results: Findings suggest that increases in daytime minor (7.9\%) and possible (7.5\%) injuries closely mirrored increases in population (9.8\%). Increases in daytime fatal/serious injuries were significantly higher (43.1\% and 35.1\%, respectively), suggesting worsening severities during the day. Increases in nighttime minor/possible injuries (31.9\% and 27.6\%, respectively) were significantly larger than those during the day, suggesting that pedestrian collisions are occurring more frequently at night. Substantial increases in nighttime fatal/serious injuries (78.0\% and 74.7\%, respectively) likely reflect a combination of worsening severity (seen throughout the day) and increasing frequency (seen particularly at night). A pedestrian injured in the dark was found to be 5.0 times more likely to be killed than a pedestrian injured during the day. While a lack of street lighting does not seem to be the cause of the disproportionate increase in pedestrian injuries at night, pedestrians struck without a street light were 2.4 times more likely to be killed than those struck in the presence of a street light.
Conclusions: As we find ourselves in the midst of a pedestrian safety crisis, understanding that severities have increased throughout the entire day and frequencies have increased particularly at night helps illuminate a path forward.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Studies have shown that perceived security discourages pedestrians from walking, which in turn reduces physical activities and associated health benefits. However, there is a dearth of research about what elements of the built environment contribute to perceived security among pedestrians and, in particular, how the perception varies amongst women and amongst men in suburban environments. The present study aims to address this gap in the literature.
Methods: A range of scenarios (i.e. more/less diversity of land use, presence/absence of trees) were presented in an online experiment to 995 participants in Brisbane (Australia). Participants reported their perceptions of being assaulted/robbed/harassed in each scenario. Random effects ordered probit models were estimated for men and women to identify the association between perceived security and built environment factors, controlling for other confounders such as age and attitudes.
Results: Women have a higher perceived risk of being assaulted/robbed/harassed compared with men in all scenarios tested in the present study. Importantly, the results indicated that while residential, commercial, and mixed land use provide a sense of security for pedestrians compared to vacant land, the effect was larger for women compared to men. There were no significant differences between vacant and recreational land use in terms of perceived security. At night, pedestrians perceived suburban environments as insecure, and the change in the level of security was higher for women than men. Also, night time security varied over different land-use types between men and women.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that targeted urban design practices (e.g., functional use of vacant land, increasing diversity of land use, adequate street lights) could be used to improve perceived security and also reduce gender inequality in security perceptions. In turn, improved perceptions of security can help to increase walking as a mode of transport.},

	abstract = {While studies of bicyclist’s perceptions of crime and crash safety exist, it is also important to ask lower-income predominantly-minority residents what bicycle-route surface or context they perceive as safest from crime and crashes. With their insights, their chosen bike environments could be in engineering guidelines and built in their neighborhoods to improve residents’ health and lessen their risk of exposure to crime or crashing. This study involved two populations in Boston: (a) community-sense participants (eight groups-church/YMCA n = 116); and (b) street-sense participants (ﬁve groups-halfway house/homeless shelter/gang members n = 96). Participants ranked and described what they saw in 32 photographs of six types of bicycle environments. Quantitative data (Likert Scale 0–6 with 0 being low risk of crime/crash) involved regression analysis to test differences. Qualitative comments were categorized into 55 themes for surface or context and if high or low in association with crime or crashes. For crime, two-way cycle tracks had a signiﬁcantly lower score (safest) than all others (2.35; p {\textless} 0.01) and share-use paths had a signiﬁcantly higher score (least safe) (3.39; p {\textless} 0.01). For crashes, participants rated shared-use paths as safest (1.17) followed by two-way cycle tracks (1.68), one-way cycle tracks (2.95), bike lanes (4.06), sharrows (4.17), and roads (4.58), with a signiﬁcant difference for any two groups (p {\textless} 0.01) except between bike lane and sharrow (p = 0.9). Street-sense participants ranked all, except shared-use paths, higher for crime and crash. For surface, wide two-way cycle tracks with freshly painted lines, stencils, and arrows were low risk for crime and a cycle track’s median, red color, stencils, and arrows low risk for crash. For context, clean signs, balconies, cafes, street lights, no cuts between buildings, and ﬂowers were low risk for crime and witnesses, little trafﬁc, and bike signals low risk for crash. As bicycle design guidelines and general Crime Perception Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles do not include these details, perhaps new guidelines could be written.},

Pedestrian crossings are intended to make it safer to cross the road, but it is not clear whether they are eﬀective at doing this after-dark, compared with during daylight. Biannual clock changes resulting from transitions to and from daylight saving time were used to compare RTCs in the UK during daylight and darkness but at the same time of day, thus controlling for potential inﬂuences on RTC numbers not related to the ambient light condition. Odds ratios and regression discontinuity analysis suggested there was a signiﬁcantly greater risk of a pedestrian RTC at a crossing after-dark than during daylight. Results also suggested the risk of an RTC afterdark was greater at a pedestrian crossing than at a location at least 50 m away from a crossing. Whilst these results show the increased danger to pedestrians using a designated crossing after-dark, this increased risk is not due to a lack of lighting at these locations as 98\% of RTCs at pedestrian crossings after-dark were lit by road lighting.

	abstract = {Background: Few studies have assessed the predictors of changes in commuting. This study investigated the associations between physical environmental characteristics and changes in active commuting.
Methods: Adults from the population-based European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort self-reported commuting patterns in 2000 and 2007. Active commuters were defined as those who reported ‘always’ or ‘usually’ walking or cycling to work. Environmental attributes around the home and route were assessed using Geographical Information Systems. Associations between potential environmental predictors and uptake and maintenance of active commuting were modelled using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and BMI.
Results: Of the 2757 participants (62\% female, median baseline age: 52, IQR: 50–56 years), most were passive commuters at baseline (76\%, n = 2099) and did not change their usual commute mode over 7 years (82\%, n = 2277). In multivariable regression models, participants living further from work were less likely to take up active commuting and those living in neighbourhoods with more streetlights were more likely to take up active commuting (both p {\textless} 0.05). Findings for maintenance were similar: participants living further from work (over 10 km, OR: 0.06; 95\% CI: 0.25 to 0.13) and had a main or secondary road on route were more likely to maintain their active commuting (OR: 0.52; 95\% CI: 0.28 to 0.98). Those living in neighbourhoods with greater density of employment locations were less likely to maintain their active commuting.
Conclusions: Co-locating residential and employment centres as well as redesigning urban areas to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists may encourage active commuting. Future evaluative studies should seek to assess the effects of redesigning the built environment on active commuting and physical activity.},

A highly influential factor is the lack of visibility at nighttime. Several studies have shown the negative effects of the lack of visibility on bicycle and pedestrian accident frequency and injury severity at nighttime. However, these studies considered only the presence or absence of light, which was not sufficient to evaluate road user safety. Only a limited number of studies in this field actually measured nighttime road illuminance levels. This study relied on the collection of road illuminance data on road links during the nighttime in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada, through the use of an illuminance sensor mounted on a scooter. Pedestrian and bicycle accident frequencies were analyzed separately with the use of the negative binomial model. Unexpectedly, the result showed that an increase in road lighting was associated with more bicycle and pedestrian accidents, which might have been explained by the decision to add or increase the amount of lighting at locations in which accidents occurred. The presence of a bike facility and arterial roads was associated with a decrease in bicycle accident occurrence. For pedestrians, the number of lanes per link and the pedestrian flow were associated with an increase in nighttime accident frequency, while the vehicle flow was associated with a decreasing number of accidents. The study called for more investigation of the precise relationship between safety and the amount of light provided by road lighting.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns road lighting for pedestrians and how this aids reassurance, their confidence when walking alone after dark. Evidence from past studies that lighting enhances reassurance is supported by the findings of an unfocussed approach that aimed deliberately to avoid focus on lighting or fear, thus to counter the unintended potential for focussed, quantitative methods to lead towards such a finding. Review of the characteristics of lighting suggests an optimum illuminance of 10 lux, of high S/P ratio, and aimed toward the pedestrian and natural elements of the environment, will enhance reassurance. Further research is needed to validate the optimum illuminance, the appropriate metric for characterising lamp spectral power distribution, and the most desirable aims of spatial distribution.},

	abstract = {This study examines the connection between the built environment, perceived safety from crime and walking behaviour by conducting a travel survey in King County, Washington State, U.S. and employing a two-stage least squares model. We seek to answer two research questions: how does the built environment affect perceived safety from crime and walking behaviour; and how does one’s perception of safety from crime affect his/her walking behaviour. Our results show that the built environment is not only signiﬁcantly related to walking behaviour, as previous research has identiﬁed, but also correlated with people’s perception of safety. In addition, a signiﬁcant association between perceived safety from crime and walking behaviour is found, revealing possible indirect impacts of the built environment on walking. In speciﬁc, people living in neighborhoods with good accessibility and pedestrian facilities tend to perceive their neighborhoods safer while density has an opposite impact. Moreover, residents in safe and high-density areas are more likely to walk.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the evidence for environmental inﬂuences on older adult health and activity participation, identiﬁes current knowledge gaps and limitations within this literature, and offers recommendations for future research via a systematic appraisal of  quantitative and qualitative studies. A Cochrane-type review procedure was followed, which incorporated structured database searches, inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality appraisal of included studies, and peer review. The review ﬁndings identify support for both personal and environmental inﬂuences on health and activity participation in later life. Reported personal inﬂuences include ethnicity and cultural norms, energy and motivation, sex, age, education, genetic heritage, self-efﬁcacy, and personal ﬁnancial circumstances. Reported environmental inﬂuences on activity participation include climate, level of pollution, street lighting, trafﬁc conditions, accessibility and appropriateness of services and facilities, socio-economic conditions, aesthetics, pedestrian infrastructure, community life, exposure to antisocial behaviour, social network participation, environmental degradation, level of urbanism, exposure to natural settings, familiarity with local environment and others. Recommendations for future research include the need for innovative research methods; involvement of older adults as research collaborators; investigation of wider aspects of the active ageing concept; in-depth assessment of the environmental characteristics of areas; investigation of the pathways leading from environment to health and activity participation; and more theoretically informed research or increased contribution of research to theory development.},

	abstract = {During the hours of darkness, the mobility of young women, the elderly and the disabled is limited in urban areas. In a field study possible predictors of the perceived visual accessibility and the perceived danger of an urban footpath were investigated. Eighty-one people individually walked along the footpath after dark. They subjectively assessed the environment and answered a questionnaire about personality and socio-demographics. Visual accessibility was predicted by visual field, environmental trust and brightness. Danger was predicted by the pleasantness of the lighting, gender, brightness and environmental trust. Consequently, the influence of individual characteristics, including the subjective judgments of brightness and hedonic tone and the personality dimension of trust in the physical environment, should be considered in the design of exterior lighting for urban footpaths.},

	abstract = {It remains unclear whether environmental conditions, including bicycle lane provision, are factors in dock-less bicycle uptake at the decision point. In conditions of generous bicycle supply and the ability to park a bicycle almost anywhere, it is important to know what local conditions might be influential in its use. The present study considered the role of 13 environmental factors in uptake and deposit rates by street segment, in a sample from a database of more than 3 m records over a ten-day period in May 2017, in Beijing, China. Street segments, defined by intersections, were coded for environmental factors using satellite and street view imagery. Uptake and especially deposit rates vary greatly by street segment and by local area. Linear regression reveals that 6 factors are highly significant in higher uptake and deposit – the presence of a dedicated bicycle pathway, street lighting, sidewalks, bicycle parking lots, POI density, and street segment length – while 3 were highly significant in lower uptake rates – interruptions in bicycle lane continuity, distance to the metro station, and elaborate environmental design. Altogether, environmental factors account for 42.4\% of the variance in local bicycle trip origins and 38.7\% of variance in destinations on street segments. This research contributes new understanding of the important role of local environmental factors in higher bicycle mode share in the context of a dock-less rental bicycle system.},

However, few studies with representative samples have examined the association between perceived neighborhood safety indicators and domain-speciﬁc active transportation in Latin America. This study aimed to examine the associations of perceived neighborhood safety with domain-speciﬁc active transportation in adults from eight Latin American countries. Data were obtained from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (n = 8547, aged 18–65). Active transportation (walking and cycling) was assessed using the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Speciﬁcally, trafﬁc density and speed as well as street lightening, visibility of residents regarding pedestrians and bicyclists, trafﬁc lights and crosswalks, safety of public spaces during the day and at night, crime rate during the day and at night were used to evaluate perceived neighborhood safety. Slow trafﬁc speeds, unsafe public spaces during the day, and crime during the day were associated with ≥10 min/week vs. {\textless}10 min/week of walking. Furthermore, drivers exceeding the speed limit and crime rate during the day were associated with reporting ≥10 min/week vs. {\textless}10 min/week of cycling. These results indicate a stronger association of the perceived neighborhood safety with walking compared to cycling.},
