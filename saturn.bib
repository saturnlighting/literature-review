	abstract = {Introduction: A promising way to stimulate physical activity is to promote the choice for active modes of transport (walking and cycling). Over the past years, several interventions and policies have been implemented to stimulate this mode shift. However, information concerning the effectiveness of these interventions and policies is still limited. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the effectiveness of interventions designed to stimulate a shift from car use to cycling or walking and to obtain insight into the intervention tools that have been used to promote and/or implement these interventions.
Methods: Five databases were searched and articles published in English, Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish were included. Only studies that focussed on a mode shift from car use towards active transport in a general adult population, which were published in peer reviewed journals and which investigated effectiveness were included. Intervention tools used were categorized by using the model of Hoogerwerf \& Herweijer, as either legal, economic (subsidy, reward system, penalty), communicative (written materials, behavioural tools) and physical tools (providing bicycles, providing better bicycle facilities at work, adjustment of the environment).
Results: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Studies included described workplace-based interventions, architectural and urbanistic adjustments, population-wide interventions, and bicycle-renting systems. Nearly all studies (except three) showed positive effects concerning a mode shift. Most of the included studies used more than one intervention tool and the tools used differed between types of interventions. However, information about the statistical signiﬁcance of these results was often lacking and the study methodologies used were not of high quality.
Conclusion: Nearly all studies showed results in a positive direction. However, the quality of the included studies was mostly low and intervention characteristics were poorly described. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Road crashes in metropolitan areas are challenging to prevent because they stem from the interactions of drivers and other system users in intricate built environments. Recent theories indicate that features of the built environment may induce unsafe driving by shaping users’ expectations and behaviors. The availability of street view imagery and methods of scene parsing create new possibilities for understanding how features of the built environment inﬂuence crash incidence. Most previous crash research using street imagery has applied manual processing methods. In this paper, we develop and apply automated machine parsed imagery in conjunction with self-explaining roads theory to consider how the street space visible to drivers inﬂuences crash frequency, using data from Columbus, Ohio, USA. While controlling for road network and area characteristics, we model the association of individual street elements with crash frequency. We then conduct a cluster analysis to deﬁne four types of street spaces, which are used in a subsequent model. We ﬁnd that an Open Road type of metropolitan street space, characterized by more visible sky, roadway, and signage are associated with the greatest increase in crashes, and that the majority of these spaces exist on arterial or collector class road segments. We theorize that the visual similarity of this type of street space to highways promotes faster, less careful driving, which combines with their mixed land uses to make them the least safe. This points to the importance of trafﬁc calming for such roads in high-activity areas, and the need to differentiate environments of non-highways from highways to promote careful driving.},

Specifically, the use of different areal unit levels in spatial road safety studies is investigated, different modelling approaches are discussed, and the corresponding study design characteristics are summarized in respective tables including traffic, road environment and area parameters and spatial aggregation approaches. Developments in famous issues in spatial analysis such as the boundary problem, the modifiable areal unit problem and spatial proximity structures are also discussed. Studies focusing on spatially analyzing vulnerable road users are reviewed as well. Regarding spatial models, the application, advantages and disadvantages of various functional/econometric approaches, Bayesian models and machine learning methods are discussed.

Due to geometrical complexities, the analysis of such data is extremely challenging, and we describe several common methodological errors. The intrinsic lack of homogeneity in a network militates against the traditional methods of spatial statistics based on stationary processes. Topics include kernel density estimation, relative risk estimation, parametric and non-parametric modelling of intensity, second-order analysis using the K -function and pair correlation function, and point process model construction. An important message is that the choice of distance metric on the network is pivotal in the theoretical development and in the analysis of real data.

	abstract = {The algorithms used for the optimal management of an ambulance ﬂeet require an accurate description of the spatio-temporal evolution of the emergency events. In the last years, several authors have proposed sophisticated statistical approaches to forecast the ambulance dispatches, typically modelling the data as a point pattern occurring on a planar region. Nevertheless, ambulance interventions can be more appropriately modelled as a realisation of a point process occurring on a road network. The constrained spatial domain raises speciﬁc challenges and unique methodological problems that cannot be ignored when developing a proper statistical approach. Hence, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal model to analyse ambulance dispatches focusing on the interventions that occurred in the road network of Milan (Italy) from 2015 to 2017. We adopt a non-separable ﬁrst-order intensity function with spatial and temporal terms. The temporal dimension is estimated semi-parametrically using a Poisson regression model, while the spatial dimension is estimated non-parametrically using a network kernel function. A set of weights is included in the spatial term to capture space-time interactions, inducing non-separability in the intensity function. A series of tests show that our approach successfully models the ambulance interventions and captures the space-time patterns more accurately than planar or separable point process models.},

This paper demonstrates a network lattice approach for identifying road segments of particular concern, based on a case study of a major city (Leeds, UK), in which 5862 crashes of different severities were recorded over an 8-year period (2011–2018). We consider a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that include spatially structured and unstructured random effects to capture the dependencies between the severity levels. Results highlight roads that are more prone to collisions, relative to estimated traffic volumes, in the north-west and south of city centre. We analyse the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), proposing a novel procedure to investigate the presence of MAUP on a network lattice. We conclude that our methods enable a reliable estimation of road safety levels to help identify ‘hotspots’ on the road network and to inform effective local interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective. To examine how adults use new local walking and cycling routes, and what characteristics predict use.
Methods. 1849 adults completed questionnaires in 2010 and 2011, before and after the construction of walking and cycling infrastructure in three UK municipalities. 1510 adults completed questionnaires in 2010 and 2012. The 2010 questionnaire measured baseline characteristics; the follow-up questionnaires captured infrastructure use.
Results. 32\% of participants reported using the new infrastructure in 2011, and 38\% in 2012. Walking for recreation was by far the most common use. In both follow-up waves, use was independently predicted by higher baseline walking and cycling (e.g. 2012 adjusted rate ratio 2.09 (95\% CI 1.55, 2.81) for N450 min/week vs. none). Moreover, there was strong speciﬁcity by mode and purpose, e.g. baseline walking for recreation speciﬁcally predicted walking for recreation on the infrastructure. Other independent predictors included living near the infrastructure, better general health and higher education or income.
Conclusions. The new infrastructure was well-used by local adults, and this was sustained over two years. Thus far, however, the infrastructure may primarily have attracted existing walkers and cyclists, and may have catered more to the socio-economically advantaged. This may limit its impacts on population health and health equity.},

Changes in urban lighting have both positive and negative effects on city performance, yet little is known about how its character and magnitude vary across the urban landscape. A major barrier to related research, planning and governance has been the lack of lighting data at the city extent, particularly at a fine spatial resolution. Our aims were therefore to capture such data using aerial night photography and to undertake a case study of urban lighting. We present the finest scale multispectral lighting dataset available for an entire city and explore how lighting metrics vary with built density and land-use. We found positive relationships between artificial lighting indicators and built density at coarse spatial scales, whilst at a local level lighting varied with land-use. Manufacturing and housing are the primary land-use zones responsible for the city’s brightly lit areas, yet manufacturing sites are relatively rare within the city. Our data suggests that efforts to address light pollution should broaden their focus from residential street lighting to include security lighting within manufacturing areas.},

Traditional methods of data collection are expensive, time consuming, and lack spatial and temporal detail. New sources have emerged as a result of crowdsourced data from ﬁtness apps, allowing cyclists to track routes using GPS enabled cell phones. Our goal is to determine if crowdsourced data from ﬁtness apps data can be used to quantify and map the spatial and temporal variation of ridership. Using data provided by Strava.com, we quantify how well crowdsourced ﬁtness app data represent ridership through comparison with manual cycling counts in Victoria, British Columbia. Comparisons are made for hourly, AM and PM peak, and peak period totals that are separated by season. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a Generalized Linear Model we modelled the relationships between crowdsourced data from Strava and manual counts and predicted categories of ridership into low, medium, and high for all roadways in Victoria. Our results indicate a linear association (r2 0.40 to 0.58) between crowdsourced data volumes and manual counts, with one crowdsourced data cyclist representing 51 riders. Categorical cycling volumes were predicted and mapped using data on slope, trafﬁc speeds, on street parking, time of year, and crowdsourced ridership with a predictive accuracy of 62\%. Crowdsourced ﬁtness data are a biased sample of ridership, however, in urban areas the high temporal and spatial resolution of data can predict categories of ridership and map spatial variation. Crowdsourced ﬁtness apps offer a new source of data for transportation planning and can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of ofﬁcial count programs.},

The method estimates the risk of accident associated with darkness in terms of an odds ratio, which is deﬁned as follows: [(number of accidents in darkness in a given hour of the day)/(number of accidents in daylight in the same hour of the day)]/[(Number of accidents in a given comparison hour when the case hour is dark)/(Number of accidents in a given comparison hour when the case hour is in daylight)]. This estimate of the risk of accident associated with darkness does not require data on exposure, but relies on the count of accidents in the same pair of hours throughout the year. One of the hours is dark part of the year, but has daylight the rest of the year. The comparison hour, which has daylight the whole year, is used to control for seasonal variations. The aim of relying on the same pair of hours throughout the year is to minimise the inﬂuence of potentially confounding factors. Estimates of the risk of injury accidents associated with darkness are developed on the basis of accident data for Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. It is found that the risk of an injury accident increases by nearly 30\% in darkness in urban areas, by nearly 50\% in rural areas, and by about 40\% for urban and rural areas combined (adjusted estimate).},

	abstract = {Objective Health impact assessment (HIA) has been proposed as one mechanism that can inform decision-making by public policymakers. However, HIA methodology has been criticized for a lack of rigour in its use of evidence. The aim of this work was to formulate, develop and test a practical guide to reviewing publicly available evidence for use in HIA. The term evidence includes all scientific assessments, whether research studies in peer-reviewed journals or previous HIAs.
Methods The formulation and development of the guide involved substantial background research, qualitative research with the target audience, substantial consultations with potential users and other stakeholders, a pilot study to explore content, format and usability, and peer review. Finally, the guide was tested in practice by invited volunteers who used it to appraise existing HIA evidence reviews. Findings During development, a wealth of data was generated on how the guide might be applied in practice, on terminology, on ensuring clarity of the text and on additional resources needed. The final guide provides advice on reviewing quantitative and qualitative research in plain language and is suitable for those working in public health but who may not have experience in reviewing evidence. During testing, it enabled users to discriminate between satisfactory and unsatisfactory evidence reviews. By late 2009, 1700 printed and 2500 downloaded copies of the guide had been distributed.
Conclusion Substantive and iterative consultation, though time-consuming, was pivotal to producing a simple, systematic and accessible guide to reviewing publicly available research evidence for use in HIA.},

	abstract = {Cycling has a range of benefits as is recognised by national and international policies aiming to increase cycling rates. Darkness acts as a barrier to people cycling, with fewer people cycling after-dark when seasonal and time-of-day factors are accounted for. This paper explores whether road lighting can reduce the negative impact of darkness on cycling rates. Changes in cycling rates between daylight and after-dark were quantified for 48 locations in Birmingham, United Kingdom, by calculating an odds ratio. These odds ratios were compared against two measures of road lighting at each location: 1) Density of road lighting lanterns; 2) Relative brightness as estimated from night-time aerial images. Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased. These results suggest only a minimal amount of lighting can promote cycling after-dark, making it an attractive mode of transport year-round.},

An alternative approach is to use objective data, specifically the number of pedestrians and cyclists present under different lighting conditions. Such data have been reported previously using a daylight savings transition approach. This paper presents a different method for analysing the effect of ambient light conditions in which data from the whole year are examined, rather than only the two weeks either side of the biannual daylight savings clock changes. The results confirm that ambient light has a significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when they are unlit. While both methods use an odds ratio approach, which should account for environmental changes other than lighting, the results suggest the daylight savings method of analysis better isolates changes in weather from the effects of ambient light on travel choice than does the whole-year method.},

The data analysed were the height at which a rising obstacle was detected, this simulating an approaching irregularity in the road surface. The results suggest that when cycling on a lit road, cycle lighting frequently offers no benefit for peripheral detection and may make it worse. It was demonstrated that position matters: At low illuminances, a hub-mounted lamp improved detection over a handlebar-mounted lamp. This benefit was sufficient to offset the reduction in detection found when decreasing road lighting from 2.0 lux to 0.2 lux.},

One reason for this is the perceived danger of cycling on roads filled with traffic. There is statistical evidence to support this perception; for equal exposure, cyclists are more likely to be seriously injured than either drivers or pedestrians. Lighting has a role to play in reducing the hazards of cycling by enhancing the visibility and conspicuity of cyclists. Unfortunately, it is not at all clear that the current lighting regulations and recommendations for cycling and cyclists are the best that can be achieved or are even adequate for these purposes. A number of actions are suggested that should enable lighting’s contribution to the safety of cyclists to be realized.},

Results of the previous analysis were reproduced in terms of the direction of the effect, but the repeated analysis found greater differences between daylight and darkness. The odds ratio determined using the new method led to higher odds ratios than the analyses used in some past studies, suggesting that past studies may have underestimated the detrimental effect of darkness on road traffic collision risk.},

Identifying the barriers and enablers to riding a bike for transport is essential to developing interventions that encourage bike riding. In this mixed-methods systematic review, we aimed to identify the perceived barriers and enablers to adults riding a bike for transport in Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) countries. A systematic database search was conducted to identify relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature. Fourty-ﬁve papers/reports met eligibility criteria. There were 34 barriers and 21 enablers identiﬁed. The leading barriers related to riding on the road alongside motor vehicles. Other factors identiﬁed included the provision and quality of cycling infrastructure, personal factors such as physical ﬁtness, attitudinal factors such as community perceptions of cyclists, and environmental factors. While this review highlights the complexity of factors that inﬂuence the uptake of riding a bike for transport, many of the leading factors could be overcome through the provision of high-quality protected infrastructure for bike riders. Other interventions to address other known barriers and enablers are needed to increase the uptake of bike riding.},

Bicycle parking has received little attention – even though bicycles are parked most of the time. This article reviews the scientiﬁc literature on bicycle parking and identiﬁes existing gaps in research and knowledge. The review analyses 94 peer-reviewed papers identiﬁed through a search in Scopus and Web of Science, in December 2017. The annual number of papers increased 15-fold between 1995 and 2017. Overall, the level of evidence on the importance of bicycle parking is limited. The majority of studies are based on crosssectional data with the presence of parking as a binary independent variable. Most studies focus on bicycle parking at public transport stops and at work places. Few studies report on bicycle parking throughout cities, and hardly any on parking at residential locations. Bicycle parking supply and quality appears to be a determinant of cycling for current and potential cyclists. Our ﬁndings can serve as input for an evidence-based debate on the role of bicycle parking. For practitioners, our research supports investment in bicycle parking, but acknowledges that a proper evaluation of such initiatives needs to be conducted to increase the level of evidence.},

A web-based survey was conducted to understand the travel patterns and the specific issues regarding bicyclists. The survey included questions about possible bicycle infrastructure improvements, policy, and program innovations to assess the perceptions of the campus community regarding these changes. The findings of this survey, conducted to understand cyclists’ travel patterns and identify their issues and concerns, are discussed. Both nonbicycle commuters and bicycle commuters agreed that bicycle lanes, trails, and paths would encourage them to ride a bike (or ride more often) to the campus. Discrete choice models are estimated to model the commuters’ mode to campus. The findings of the models suggest that people are more sensitive to time for nonmotorized modes and women are less likely to ride a bicycle. Those who perceive walking and biking as a form of exercise and identify flexibility of departure time as an important factor in their mode choice are more likely to ride a bicycle. Those more likely to choose to drive an automobile to campus assume that they do not have other options to commute to campus. Policies designed to promote the use of bicycle transportation on and to the campus based on these findings are presented. The results of this study will help practitioners and campus transportation planners understand the reasons that prevent people from bicycling and evaluate the transportation improvements that may be considered to achieve bicycle-friendly campuses.},

Socioeconomic data, travel preferences, mode accessibility, and individual factors of the surveyed population are used to identify generators of gender diﬀerence. To investigate gender equity, we develop a bivariate statistical analysis along with a twolevel nested logit model. The results of the bivariate statistical analysis indicate females are about 30\% less likely to bicycle from home to campus and are signiﬁcantly more sensitive to environmental and infrastructural conditions. Complementary to the bivariate statistical analysis, the results of the two-level nested logit model demonstrate that distant trips, longer travel times, not having access to a bicycle, and an unsafe environment avert females from bicycling. We also ﬁnd that undergraduate females are less likely to bike to campus than other group of students. The ﬁndings highlight that the integration of bicycle and transit services, advancing infrastructure to separate bicycle from motorized traﬃc, improving safety in bicycle facilities, and enhancing public knowledge about local bicycle routes promote bicycling among females.},

Whilst many UK cities have had some success increasing overall cycling numbers in recent years, women are still far less likely to cycle, often because of concerns with journey quality related to traﬃc safety and social safety. CLoS tools are used by planners and engineers to assess existing routes and ensure they are safe, direct and continuous. However, whilst CLoS tools are seen to provide objective measures of some principles, we argue that they fail to attribute enough importance to gendered diﬀerences in perceptions of social safety. Based upon qualitative go-along and interview data, we assess the Welsh CLoS tool, demonstrating that it allows routes considered to be unrideable by female cyclists to be designated as rideable because there is no requirement to take mandatory remedial action regarding what are shown to be critically low scores on indicators of social safety. Whilst larger studies are required to validate these ﬁndings, our data suggests that the safety component of the CLoS tool can only be considered objective from a male point of view and inadequately considers the perspectives and needs of women. Moreover, we argue that in mandating socially unsafe routes as safe, CLoS actively reproduces gendered ‘essences’ such as vulnerability. As a result we suggest that CLoS urgently needs to be incorporated into gender and equalities audits if it is to accurately reﬂect the needs of more diverse user groups.},
