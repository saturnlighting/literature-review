# Summary

Evidence shows that darkness discourages people from cycling [@mendiate_cycling_2022; @ribbens_impact_2008; @winters_built_2010; @uttley_road_2020].
This is due to a higher perceived danger of cyclists at night from motorised traffic and personal security, which disproportionately affect women [@sustrans_bikelife_2018].

Road lighting increases cyclists' sense of safety at night by helping them see and be seen by other road users during their journey. It also provides them with a greater sense of security against possible threats in the dark.

Using night lighting data, Strava Metro data, and other environmental datasets, we intend to examine in-depth the relationship between road lighting and cycling.

Our findings are intended to influence future lighting design and cycling infrastructure standards to make cycling safer and more equitable.
