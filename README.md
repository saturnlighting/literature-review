Road Lighting and Cycling Uptake: A review
================

<!-- Shouldn't be darkness instead of road lighting? -->

**Abstract**

<Background>Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle
lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in
relation to investment in cycling. Much less attention has been given to
localised treatments such as appropriate lighting or cycle parking which
can have a major impact on cyclability. There is evidence suggesting
that darkness discourages people from cycling. This is due to a higher
perceived danger of cyclists at night from motorised traffic and
personal security, which disproportionately affect women, the elderly,
and disadvantaged groups. Appropriate road lighting can increase
feelings of reassurance, make hazards more visible, and make the cyclist
more visible to other road users, which can increase cycling uptake and
make it safer and more equitable. <Aim>This paper provides a review of
the scientific literature that investigates how road lighting/darkness
affects cycling uptake. <Method>We used a hybrid systematic and
snowballing method. TBC studies on several disciplines such as

# Introduction

Benefits of cycling are well established in the literature. Cycling
improves physical, mental, and social health; reduces pollution, carbon
emissions, and congestion; and it is more inclusive than private
motorised modes, reducing inequalities (Oja et al. 2011). For this
reason, cycling is encouraged. Yet, most people keep choosing to drive
to cycle.

Many studies have explored the extent to which the built environment
(e.g. population density, land use mix, proximity, spatial connectivity)
and especially safe cycling infrastructure affects cycling uptake.
However, less investigated have been micro-built environmental factors
such as road lighting, which may have a strong influence on people
choice to cycle.

There is evidence suggesting that darkness discourages people from
cycling (e.g…). This is due to a higher perceived danger of cyclists at
night from motorised traffic and crime and personal security, which
disproportionately affect women, the elderly, and disadvantaged groups
(Schneider, Wiers, and Schmitz 2022).

<!-- Mention the rest of literature review fond in the search? -->

Previous academic literature reviews have touched on elements of the
relationship between cycling and lighting. For example, Fotios and
Castleton (2017) reviewed suggested interventions to enable cycling
lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists in the UK. Reynolds et
al. (2009) reviewed the impact of transport infrastructure, including
street lighting, on cycling collisions. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no academic paper has reviewed the international literature
available on the relationship between road lighting and cycling uptake.
This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature.

<!-- The review is guided by the following questions: -->
<!-- 1.  To what extent does darkness influence cycling behaviour? -->
<!-- 2.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among cyclists? -->
<!-- 3.  Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between different groups? -->

We focus on road lighting, excluding studies on lighting equipment for
cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights.

The review is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the method.
Section 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed. Section 4
critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the literature.
Section 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- ## Search strategy -->
<!-- Two methods were used to conduct the literature review: (a) a systematic search, and (b) additional smaller searches and snowballing.  -->
<!-- For completeness, separate smaller searches and snowballing were applied for the theoretical review as well as when the researchers were aware that a body of literature existed, but our systematic search had not picked up on it.  -->

We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. First, we searched
in the SCOPUS electronic databased (on 15 November 2022) for empirical
studies investigating the relationship between cycling and road
lighting. The query string used for the search was as follows:

*(bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR cyclist\* OR “cycle hire”) AND (“city
light\*” OR “public light\*” OR “road light\*” OR “street light\*” or
“city illumination” OR “public illumination” OR “road illumination” OR
“street illumination” OR “city lamp\*” OR “public lamp\*” OR “road
lamp\*” OR “street lamp\*” OR “lamp post\*” OR “light post\*” OR “light
pole\*”)*

This search, based on the content of the title, abstract, and keywords,
resulted in 262 records. After screening abstracts and full text, TBC
studies were selected. We excluded papers that did not focus on cycling
and road lighting (many studies mentioned cycling and lighting in
passing but not as the topic of the paper). We also excluded the papers
referring to how light influenced not cycling uptake but the road safety
of cyclists.

In the second stage, we checked the references from the studies selected
(i.e. snowball technique), and after screening abstracts and full texts,
TBC additional papers were selected. In total, TBC were reviewed. A flow
chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

<!-- We removed the reviews such as: -->
<!-- - Cycling in sub-Saharan African cities: Differences and similarities with developed world cities -->
<!-- Paper we did not have access: -->
<!-- - S. Chandra, R. Radhakrishnan, Street visibility-dependent path finding for pedestrians and bicyclists in urban areas, Transportation Research Board 94th Annual Meeting, Transportation Research Board, Washington DC, United States, 2015. -->

## Data extraction

From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: author(s)
and year, method, measurements, trip purpose, sign of association,
location of study, sample size.

# Results

<Subject area>The scientific literature was found to be broadly spread
across several disciplines, including engineering, transport, road
safety, and public health.

<!-- <Themes>Five main themes emerged: -->
<!-- 1.  Cycling behaviour and lighting -->
<!-- 2.  Cycling collisions and lighting -->
<!-- 3.  Cycling, crime and lighting -->
<!-- 4.  Cycling inequalities in lighting -->
<!-- 5.  Proper lighting for cyclists  -->
<!-- (i.e. optimal use of lighting to enhance cyclists reassurance while respecting the environment) -->

<Study type>Most of the studies were written in the last decade, TBC
were empirical and TBC were reviews (Figure 1).

<!-- <type of empirical papers> Most of the empirical studies were quantitative (), five of them qualitative, and one of them mixed methods. -->

## Cycling behaviour and lighting

<!-- I could also divide the section on quantitative studies and objective and subjective. -->

Previous research has found a positive association between street
lighting and physical activity (PA) and active travel (AT). In children
(Prince et al. 2022) and older people (Bonaccorsi et al. 2020).

<!-- Add perhaps other reviews. I should not include reviews on our papers reviewed! -->

Street lighting increases cyclists’ sense of safety at night by helping
them see and be seen by other road users during their journey. It also
provides them with a greater sense of security against possible threats
in the dark.

A recent review on differences and similarities in cycling between
sub-Saharan African cities (SSA) and developed world cities (DWC) found
that studies in both SSA cities and DWC are unanimous that street
lighting has an important influence on cycling (Mendiate et al. 2022).
“Ribbens (2008) indicate that cyclists avoid poorly lit streets in the
townships of South Africa. Buyana and Shuaib (2014) indicate that
cyclists in the suburbs of Kampala are likely to forego a trip if the
access road is not well-lit. Similarly, Winters et al. (2010) in their
study in Vancouver (Canada) cite that not well-lit bicycle lanes are
strongly linked to the reduction of cycling rates. In addition, Chandra
and Radhakrishnan (2015) indicate that people avoid cycling in areas
with cycle paths that do not have street lights at night” (Mendiate et
al. 2022). “lack of street lighting can contribute to poor visibility,
perception and fear of crime thus decreasing bicycle use. This is
particularly relevant in SSA due to the generalized lack of security and
safety.” (Mendiate et al. 2022).

In a review on research on built environment and physical activity among
children and youth, prince_examining_2022 found street lighting
positively associated with total physical activity among youth and
children/youth, but not among children.

Luo et al. (2022) found that nighttime brightness had pronounce effects
on active travel.

Using Strava Heatmap data and spatial regression models, Linchuan Yang
et al. (2022) found street lighting positively associated with running,
but not with cycling.

Using odd ratios to compare traffic flows in case and control hours,
Fotios and Robbins (2022) found that darkness had a significant negative
effect on the number of pedestrians and cyclists, but not on the number
of motorized vehicles.

Using satellite and street view imagery and linear regressions,
Zacharias and Meng (2021) found street lighting highly significantly
associated with higher uptake and deposit of dock-less shared bicycle
trips.

“Elements positively associated with physical activity in older adults
were (…) street lighting; crime-related safety; traffic-related safety.
Negatively associated with physical activity were (…) barriers to
walking/cycling; crime-related unsafety; unattended dogs; inadequate
street lighting and upkeep; vandalism, etc.” (Bonaccorsi et al. 2020).

Using odd ratios, Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace (2020) found that the
drop in cycling levels after dark was substantially greater in unlit
locations, compared with lit locations. Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace
(2020) also found a non-linear relationship between relative brightness
and the reduction in cyclists after-dark, suggesting that a minimal
amount of lighting could be enough to promote cycling after dark.

“Pedestrians and cyclists have similar preferences for road segments
with building lower than 6 floors, 50% retail shops in frontage, more
greenery, lamps between 15 m and 30 m, more crossing facilities, wider
sidewalk/bike lane and not crowded” (Liu et al. 2020).

Fotios, Uttley, and Fox (2019) found that “ambient light has a
significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle
when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle
trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when
they are unlit”.

This supported previous work which “indicated the numbers of pedestrians
and cyclists during the case period were significantly higher during
daylight conditions than after-dark, resulting in a 62% increase in
pedestrians and a 38% increase in cyclists” (Uttley and Fotios 2017).

“Some bicyclists favor routes which are planted with street trees or
installed with street lights” (Chen, Shen, and Childress 2018).

Using self-reported commuting data, Lin Yang et al. (2017) found that
individuals living in neighbourhoods with higher density of street light
were more likely to active commuting.

In a review of forty two quantitative studies that estimated association
between neighbourhood built environment and active travel in older
adults, Cerin et al. (2017) observed positive associations with
availability of street lights.

In a paper that estimated welfare change associated with improvements in
urban bicycling facilities, Poorfakhraei and Rowangould (2015) found
that “cycle tracks were valued the most, followed by street lighting,
and bicycle lanes”.

“The presence of street lighting increased the likelihood of daily
cycling in \< 75 years old females and rural females but not in other
subgroups.” (Van Cauwenberg et al. 2012).

“Winters et al. (2011) found that a major deterrent to cycling was if
the route was not well lit after-dark. The deterrent effect was largest
for people who don’t currently cycle but potentially would do in the
future, highlighting the importance of lighting in encouraging uptake of
cycling” (Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace 2020).

Respondents in a study that examined if neighbourhood environments were
associated with walking and cycling, reported that good lighting at
night is an important facilitator of cycling (Lee and Moudon 2008).

“Nightfall was more of a deterrent to bicycling than walking” (Cervero
and Duncan 2003).

## Cycling, crime, and lighting

Another factor that explains why there is less cycling at night is the
fear of crime. This is much less investigated than the relationship
between lighting and cycling collisions. There is evidence that street
lighting decreases crime and enhances reassurance and confidence of
pedestrians and cyclists after dark (e.g. Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022).

“Variables related to crime and lighting of public spaces were
associated with active travel in countries in Latin America”
(Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022).

Lusk et al. (2019) asked lower-income predominantly-minority residents
what bicycle routes surface or context they perceived as safest from
crime and crashes. They reported that “clean signs, balconies, cafes,
street lights, no cuts between buildings, and flowers were low risk for
crime and witnesses, little traffic, and bike signals low risk for
crash”.

“Violent crimes appear to significantly deter people from choosing to
walk or bicycle, potentially exposing themselves to threats of personal
injury” (Appleyard and Ferrell 2017).

“High-crime neighborhoods tend to discourage residents from walking or
riding a bicycle” (Ferrell and Mathur 2012).

Cervero and Kockelman (1997) “suggested that the presence of road
lighting and the distance between lamps were significant aspects of
neighbourhood design that contributed to encouraging non-automobile
travel”.

“Children whose routes had a high density of streetlights were less
likely to cycle to school” (Panter et al. 2010).

## Cycling inequalities in lighting

Fear of danger of injury from traffic, falls, or violence seems to
affect groups differently.

<Gender>

Fotios, Uttley, and Gorjimahlabani (2022) found that darkness has a
greater deterrent effect on female cyclists than on male cyclists.

“Recent research (Sustrans 2018) found that only 23% of women felt safe
cycling during hours of darkness, compared with 36% of men, which
suggests that Lighting may also contribute to addressing the current
gender imbalance in cycling by encouraging more women to cycle
after-dark” (Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace 2020).

“Women are less likely to cycle to work in the dark, so women are more
sensitive to the absence of daylight” (**heinen_day?**–day_2011).

“Darkness was also more important to women than to men, but with a mean
grading of 3.0 in the survey of 1998, and 2.7 in the survey of 2000,
this factor could still not, not even for women, be considered to be
important in the choice of mode” (Bergström and Magnusson 2003).

<!-- "Women are more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men" [@xie_i_2018]. -->

<Age>

<Disadvantaged groups>

“Both traffic safety concerns and personal security concerns were most
strongly associated with poor neighborhood opportunities for exercise.
Respondents living in lower-income communities reported greater barriers
to pedestrian and bicycle safety and security than residents from
wealthier neighborhoods” (Schneider, Wiers, and Schmitz 2022).

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of cycling and lighting
is spread across several disciplines such as engineering, transport,
road safety, and public health.

Below, based on the results of the review, we answer the questions that
guide this paper.

In some cities the influence of road lighting will have a bigger impact
than in others. For example in Madrid, Valencia and Seville there are
around 2,900 hours of annual sunshine. Barcelona: 2,400. Compared to
1632 hours of sunlight per year in Oslo.

Street lighting provision. Big differences countries. Sprawl/dense urban
areas. 69.9% agree that streets are well lit Latin America
(Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022). Spain vs the UK.

#### To what extent does darkness influence cycling uptake?

The positive results obtained in studies looking at the association
between cycling uptake and street lighting show the importance of light
conditions as a policy measure to encourage cycling in the dark.
Lighting conditions improvements not only may increase cycling trips in
general, but also the inclusivity of cycling, since, as has been
demonstrated, street lighting will benefit more certain groups such as
women, children, the elderly, and disadvantaged populations.

#### Is this negative effect due to fear of being run over by motorirsed traffic or a victim of crime in the dark?

#### Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between different groups?

#### What happens to people who do not cycle when it is dark? Do they avoid their trips? Do they change their mode of transport? Do they change their routes?

#### What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cycling to increase and be safer?

#### Is traffic stress or darkness a bigger barrier to cycling (and impact of lighting)? –\>

## Research gaps

- Many studies fail to separate walking and cycling. The characteristics
  of environments encouraging walking may be different from those
  supporting cycling.

- Differences in different latitudes.

<!-- -   Lack of research in developing countries -->

## Strenghts and limitations

- We do not know whether there is difference in terms of age. Fotios,
  Uttley, and Gorjimahlabani (2022) considered age only for pedestrians.
  “The ORs for younger and older pedestrians were suggested to be
  significantly different (young OR = 1.58, old OR = 3.38, z = 3.800,
  p\<0.001), indicating that darkness is a greater deterrent to old
  pedestrians than to young pedestrians” (Fotios, Uttley, and
  Gorjimahlabani 2022).

# Conclusions

This paper reviewed published research on the intersection between
cycling and road lighting.

<gaps>Despite the recent growth of articles on this subject, it is still
under-researched. More empirical work in the area of cycling and road
lighting is needed.

<!-- The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of cycling uptake (which means tackling the barriers to cycling including road safety and perceived personal safety) and lighting.  -->
<!-- We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body.  -->
<!-- During the project we plan to  measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations.  -->
<!-- Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.  -->
<!-- Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety.  -->
<!-- To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting (Fotios et al., 2017), as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide. -->
