The effect of road lighting on cycling uptake: A review
================

<!-- Alternative title:
- Road lighting and cycling uptake
- Ambient light, lighting, and cycling rates -->

**Abstract**

<Background>Many studies have explored the extent to which macro-built
environmental attributes (e.g. population density, land use mix,
proximity, spatial connectivity), and especially bicycle paths and
lanes, affect cycling uptake. Less attention has been paid to the impact
that micro-built environmental factors such as road lighting may have on
people’s choice to cycle. This paper provides a review of the scientific
literature on the relationship between road lighting and cycling uptake
and identifies existing gaps in research and knowledge. <Method>We used
a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. Nine empirical scientific
studies were reviewed. These studies can be divided into those that use
a subjective measurement of road lighting and those that use an
objective measurement. <Results>Most of the studies analysed indicate
that road lighting has a strong positive effect on cycling levels during
the night. The impact is higher among women. This suggests that road
lighting may be a key measure to increase cycling and make it safer and
more equitable. More research is needed, including on the reasons road
lighting is relevant to cyclists, the different impacts that road
lighting may have on cyclist groups, the appropriate road lighting for
cyclists, and in developing countries and countries with extreme
latitudes. <Conclusion>

<!-- To what extent darkness or lack of road lighting deter people from cycling? -->
<!-- Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to investment in cycling.  -->
<!-- However, localised treatments such as appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on cyclability.  -->
<!-- There is evidence suggesting darkness discourages people from cycling, and increases the risk of being involved in a collision whilst cycling.  -->
<!-- Appropriate road or path lighting can increase feelings of reassurance, make hazards more visible, and make the cyclist more visible to other road users.  -->
<!-- However, there is to date little evidence on the lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other measures.  -->
<!-- Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling uptake, at all times and in all seasons? -->

# Introduction

Benefits of cycling are well established in the literature. Cycling
improves physical, mental, and social health; reduces pollution, carbon
emissions, and congestion; and it is more inclusive than private
motorised modes, reducing inequalities (Oja et al. 2011). For this
reason, cycling is generally encouraged. Yet, cycling levels are low in
most cities around the world.

Many studies have explored the extent to which macro-built environmental
attributes such as population density, land use mix, proximity, spatial
connectivity and especially safe cycling infrastructure affects cycling
uptake (e.g. (Buehler and Pucher 2012; Fraser and Lock 2011; Winters et
al. 2016). However, less investigated have been micro-built
environmental factors such as road lighting, which may have a strong
influence on people choice to cycle.

There is evidence suggesting that darkness discourages people from
cycling (Fotios and Robbins 2022; Fotios, Uttley, and Fox 2019; Uttley
and Fotios 2017). This is due to a higher perceived danger of cyclists
at night from motorised traffic and crime and personal security, which
disproportionately affect women, the elderly, and disadvantaged groups
Schneider, Wiers, and Schmitz (2022). Road lighting can provide
reassurance to cyclists to overcome this barrier, increasing cycling
levels, and making cycling safer and more equitable.
<!-- Any other relevant literature review fond in the search? -->
<!-- Previous research has found a positive association between street lighting and physical activity (PA) and active travel (AT) [@prince_examining_2022; @bonaccorsi_impact_2020]. -->

Previous academic literature reviews have touched on elements of the
relationship between cycling and lighting. For example, Fotios and
Castleton (2017) reviewed suggested interventions to enable cycling
lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists in the UK. Reynolds et
al. (2009) reviewed the impact of transport infrastructure, including
street lighting, on cycling collisions. Other reviews have look at the
association between active travel or physical and environmental factors,
including street lighting (e.g. Cerin et al. (2017); Prince et al.
(2022)). However, to the best of our knowledge, no academic paper has
reviewed the international literature available on the relationship
between road lighting and specifically cycling uptake. This paper aims
to fill this gap in the literature.

The review is guided by the following questions:

1.  To what extent does road lighting influence cycling uptake?

2.  What are the possible causes of this positive association?

3.  Is the association the same between different groups?

4.  What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cyclists?

The review is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the method.
Section 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed. Section 4
critically analyses the findings, responding the review questions, and
identifies gaps in the literature. Section 5 closes the work with the
conclusio ns.

# Method

## Search strategy

We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. First, we searched
in Elsevierś Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) (on 11 January 2023) for
empirical studies investigating the relationship between cycling and
road lighting. All searches were based on the content of the title,
abstract, and keywords, and the query string used for the search was as
follows:

<!-- the two the main sources for citation data, Elsevierś Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) (on 6 January 2023) [@mongeon_journal_2016] -->

*(“city light\*” OR “public light\*” OR “road light\*” OR “street
light\*” or “city illumination” OR “public illumination” OR “road
illumination” OR “street illumination” OR “city lamp\*” OR “public
lamp\*” OR “road lamp\*” OR “street lamp\*” OR “lamp post\*” OR “light
post\*” OR “light pole\*”) AND (bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR
cyclist\* OR “cycle hire”)*

The search resulted in 124 records in Scopus and 206 in WoS. Only
studies that strictly focused on the relationship between road lighting
and cycling uptake were selected. We excluded, therefore, studies that
examined the relationship between road lighting and cycling safety
safety, studies that analysed the association between ambient lighting
or darkness and cycling uptake, and studies on lighting equipment for
cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights. After
combining the search results, excluding duplicates, and examining
abstracts and full texts for this content, 8 studies were selected.

Second, to make sure we didn’t miss any important studies, we checked
the references from the studies selected (i.e. snowball technique), and
after screening abstracts and full texts of these references, 1
additional paper was selected. In total, 9 studies were reviewed. A flow
chart of the search strategy is shown in Figure 1.

## Data extraction

The following information was extracted from each study: author(s) and
year, location of study, measurements for cycling and lighting, type of
measurements, method or analytical tool, and results (Table 1).
<!-- For analytical reasons, the type of measurements were classified into subjective and objective, depending on whether the associations were perceived (subjective) or objectively measured (objective). -->

# Results

## Trends and types of research

The scientific literature on the relationship between road lighting and
cycling uptake was found to be broadly spread across several
disciplines, including engineering, public health, urban
design/planning, and transport planning.

Research on the relationship between road lighting and cycling uptake
seems very recent. All the studies found were written in the last
fifteen years. Most of the studies were from North America (5), 2 from
South America, 1 from the United Kingdom, and 1 from China.

For the purposes of this analysis, the studies can be divided into those
that examine the relationships between road lighting and cycling uptake
using descriptive analysis and inferential analysis. Another useful
categorization of studies is based on the type of road lighting
measurement, which can be subjective or objective.

<!-- Correlational research studies and Descriptive research studies. -->
<!-- "Subjective measures of reassurance are prone to stimulus range bias and socially desirable responding, and, as stated preferences, it is unknown whether they are reflected in behaviour (revealed preference). -->
<!-- A more direct approach to investigating whether road lighting influence cycling is to count the number of people using these transport modes in different light conditions. If darkness reduces reassurance, then there will be fewer pedestrians and cyclists. This has been investigated, and confirmed, in studies taking advantage of variation in daylight, either the seasonal variation or the sudden transition imposed by biannual daylight saving clock changes" [@fotios_extending_2022]. Objective measures of behaviour provide stronger evidence. -->
<!-- Range bias in evaluations of perceived safety [@fotios_specifying_2016]. -->
<!-- "The daylight savings method of analysis better isolates changes in weather from the effects of ambient light on travel choice than does the whole-year method" [@fotios_whole-year_2019]. -->

## Empirical findings

<!-- Divide perhaps between objective and subjective studies -->

An study that examined the association between perceived neighborhood
safety indicators and domain-specific active transportation in Latin
America found that “the odds of cycling participation and duration is
not higher in participants who agreed that streets were well lit”
(Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022).

Using satellite and street view imagery and linear regressions,
Zacharias and Meng (2021) found that “street lighting is positively
associated with dock-less shared bicycle uptake and deposit”.

Using odd ratios, Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace (2020) found that the
drop in cycling levels after dark was substantially greater in unlit
locations, compared with lit locations. Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace
(2020) also found “a non-linear relationship between relative brightness
and the reduction in cyclists after-dark, suggesting that a minimal
amount of lighting could be enough to promote cycling after dark”.

Fotios, Uttley, and Fox (2019) found that “more people cycle on cycle
trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when
they are unlit”.

“Some bicyclists favor routes which are planted with street trees or
installed with street lights” (Chen, Shen, and Childress 2018).

In a paper that estimated welfare change associated with improvements in
urban bicycling facilities, Poorfakhraei and Rowangould (2015) found
that “cycle tracks were valued the most, followed by street lighting,
and bicycle lanes”.

“Street lighting and security are two of the main factors (5 and 6 out
of 18) for cycle commuting routes after 1) number of trucks 2) buses and
3) traffic volume and 4) speed” (Segadilha and Sanches 2014).

“Increasing street lighting is the second top suggestions for cyclists
to improve safety” (Sanders and Cooper 2013).

Respondents in a study that examined if neighbourhood environments were
associated with walking and cycling, reported that good lighting at
night is an important facilitator of cycling (Lee and Moudon 2008).

# Discussion

This paper reviewed the scientific literature on the relationship
between road lighting and cycling uptake.

#### To what extent does road lighting influence cycling uptake?

The positive results obtained in studies looking at the association
between cycling uptake and street lighting show the importance of light
conditions as a policy measure to encourage cycling in the dark.
Lighting conditions improvements not only may increase cycling trips in
general, but also the inclusivity of cycling, since, as has been
demonstrated, street lighting will benefit more certain groups such as
women.

#### What are the possible causes of this positive association?

Road lighting help cyclists at night to visualize their route in the
dark (allowing obstacles and trip hazards to be seen and avoided). It
makes cyclists feel more visible and less at risk of being hit by
motorised traffic during their journeys at night. Also, it provides them
with a greater sense of security against possible threats in the dark.

Another factor that explains why there is less cycling at night is the
fear of crime. This is much less investigated than the relationship
between lighting and cycling collisions. There is evidence that street
lighting decreases crime and enhances reassurance and confidence of
pedestrians and cyclists after dark (e.g. Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022).

<!-- "Variables related to crime and lighting of public spaces were associated with active travel in countries in Latin America" [@castillo-paredes_perceived_2022]. -->
<!-- "Violent crimes appear to significantly deter people from choosing to walk or bicycle, potentially exposing themselves to threats of personal injury" [@appleyard_influence_2017]. -->
<!-- "High-crime neighborhoods tend to discourage residents from walking or riding a bicycle" [@ferrell_influences_2012]. -->
<!-- @cervero_travel_1997 "suggested that the presence of road lighting and the distance between lamps were significant aspects of neighbourhood design that contributed to encouraging non-automobile travel". -->

#### Is the association the same between different groups?

<!-- Fear of danger of injury from traffic, falls, or violence seems to affect groups differently. -->

Fotios, Uttley, and Gorjimahlabani (2022) found that the deterrent of
darkness for cycling was greater for females than for males. Heinen,
Maat, and Wee (2011) found that women are less likely to cycle to work
in the dark.

<!-- "Recent research [@sustrans_bikelife_2018] found that only 23% of women felt safe cycling during hours of darkness, compared with 36% of men, which suggests that Lighting may also contribute to addressing the current gender imbalance in cycling by encouraging more women to cycle after-dark" [@uttley_road_2020]. -->
<!-- "Women are more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men" [@xie_i_2018]. -->
<!-- "The dominant deterrents to bicycle commuting are unpleasant weather and inadequate daylight" [@stinson_frequency_2004] -->

#### What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cyclists?

Studies used different measurements for road lighting, without
specifying the type or levels of lighting. Find out the most suitable,
environmentally friendly and “green” solution to fulfill the cyclists
road lighting requirements.

Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace (2020) found “a non-linear relationship
between relative brightness and the reduction in cyclists after-dark,
suggesting that a minimal amount of lighting could be enough to promote
cycling after dark”.

(Fotios and Castleton 2017)

## Research gaps

Based on these findings, we highlight the following research needs:

- More focus on the effect of road lighting specifically on cycling.
  Many studies look at road lighting and physical activity and active
  travel, failing to separate walking and cycling. The characteristics
  of environments encouraging walking may be different from those
  supporting cycling.

- More research on the reasons why road lighting is important for
  cyclists. Which of the possible reasons has more weight? Because it
  helps them to visualize their route in the dark? To make them feel
  more visible and less at risk of being hit? Or to make them feel safer
  from being a victim of crime? Answers to these questions may help to
  adopt different policies to reduce the impact of darkness on cycling
  levels.

- Deeper understanding on how road lighting affects different cyclist
  groups (frequent cyclists, occasional cyclists, or potential
  cyclists). Also gender-age groups are under-research. Do young female
  perceive cycling in the dark more dangerous than other women-age
  groups due to the risk of sexual assault?

- Further research is needed on the specific type of road lighting
  appropriate for cyclists.

- More research in developing countries. “Lack of street lighting can
  contribute to poor visibility, perception and fear of crime thus
  decreasing bicycle use. This is particularly relevant in Sub-Saharan
  Africa due to the generalized lack of security and safety” (Mendiate
  et al. 2022). Poor infrastructure. Low road lighting density.

- More research in extreme latitude locations, which have longer
  durations of darkness during parts of the year.

- Who is most affected by the need for road lighting when cycling?
  Frequent cyclists, occasional cyclists, or potential cyclists?

<!-- -   Lack of research in developing countries -->

## Strenghts and limitations

<Strength>This paper provides a review of the scientific literature on
the relationship between road lighting and cycling uptake and identifies
existing gaps in research and knowledge. To the best of our knowledge,
no papers had looked at this association and gaps in the literature
before. <Limitations>Nevertheless, the paper has several limitations:

- The method used for this review (using two search databases and the
  snowball technique) tries to guarantee a wide coverage. However, we
  are aware that some studies not included in the selected search
  databased, nor in the references of the papers found, or included in
  the search databased but not found when filtering by title, abstract,
  and keywords have not been reviewed.

- We do not include and analyse the controls used in each of the
  studies.

# Conclusions

This paper reviewed academic research on the association between road
lighting and cycling uptake.

<gaps>Despite the recent growth of articles on this topic, it is still
under-researched. More empirical work in the area of cycling and road
lighting is needed.

<!-- The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of cycling uptake (which means tackling the barriers to cycling including road safety and perceived personal safety) and lighting.  -->
<!-- We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body.  -->
<!-- During the project we plan to  measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations.  -->
<!-- Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.  -->
<!-- Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety.  -->
<!-- To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting (Fotios et al., 2017), as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide. -->
