<Background>Evidence shows that darkness discourages people from
cycling. This is mostly due to a higher perceived danger of cyclists at
night from motorised traffic and personal security. This

intersects between cycling and road lighting to better understand the
relationship between both terms. <Method>We used a hybrid systematic and
snowballing method. TBC studies on several disciplines such as
engineering and technology, transportation, road safety, and public
health were reviewed. <Results>The literature suggests that… Gaps in the

# Introduction

Benefits of cycling are well established in the literature. Cycling
improves physical, mental, and social health; reduces pollution, carbon
emissions, and congestion; and it is more inclusive than private
motorised modes, reducing inequalities. For this reason, cycling is
being encouraged. Yet, most people keep choosing to drive to cycle.

One of the main determinants of cycling is fear of motorised
vehicles<reference needed>. Many studies have explored to what extent
safe cycling infrastructure affects cycling.<add brief conclusions here>
However, less investigated have been other micro-built environmental
factors such as road lighting, which may have a strong influence on
people’s fear when cycling.

<!-- Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to investment in walking and cycling. However, localised treatments such as appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on cyclability. There is much evidence suggesting darkness puts people off from cycling, and increases the risk of being involved in a collision whilst cycling. Appropriate road or path lighting can increase feelings of reassurance, make hazards more visible, and make the cyclist more visible to other road users. However, there is to date little evidence on the lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other measures. Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling uptake, at all times and in all seasons? -->

Previous academic literature reviews have touched on elements of the
relationship between cycling and lighting. S. Fotios and Castleton
(2017) reviewed suggested interventions to enable cycling lighting to
contribute to the safety of cyclists in the UK. However, to the best of
our knowledge, no academic paper has reviewed the international
literature available on the intersection between both terms, cycling and
road lighting.

This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature, reviewing published
research specifically focussed at the intersection between cycling and
road lighting.

The review is guided by the following questions:

<!-- replace darkness with road lighting? -->

1.  To what extent does darkness influence cycling behaviour?

2.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of road collision
    among cyclists?

3.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of
    crime among cyclists?

4.  Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between
    different groups?

5.  What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cycling to
    increase and be safer?

We focus on road and/or ambient lighting, excluding studies on lighting
equipment for cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted
lights.

The review is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the method.
Section 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed. Section 4
critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the literature.
Section 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- ## Search strategy -->
<!-- Two methods were used to conduct the literature review: (a) a systematic search, and (b) additional smaller searches and snowballing.  -->
<!-- For completeness, separate smaller searches and snowballing were applied for the theoretical review as well as when the researchers were aware that a body of literature existed, but our systematic search had not picked up on it.  -->

We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. First, we searched
in the SCOPUS electronic databased (on 15 November 2022) for studies
investigating the relationship between cycling and road lighting. The
query string used for the search was as follows:

*(bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR cyclist\* OR “cycle hire”) AND (“city
light\*” OR “public light\*” OR “road light\*” OR “street light\*” or
“city illumination” OR “public illumination” OR “road illumination” OR
“street illumination” OR “city lamp\*” OR “public lamp\*” OR “road
lamp\*” OR “street lamp\*” OR “lamp post\*” OR “light post\*” OR “light
pole\*”)*

This search, based on the content of the title, abstract, and keywords,
resulted in 262 records. After screening abstracts and full text, TBC
studies were selected. We excluded papers that did not focus on cycling
and road lighting (many studies mentioned cycling and lighting in
passing but not as the topic of the paper).

<!-- We excluded the following papers that could not be accessed: 

- Automated intelligent public lighting system

- Using of green energy from sustainable pavement plates for lighting bikeways

- Changing the DNA of city streets: NACTO's urban street design guide and the new city street design paradigm
-->

In the second stage, we checked the references from the studies selected
(i.e. snowball technique), and after screening abstracts and full texts,
TBC additional papers were selected. In total, TBC were reviewed. A flow
chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

<!-- ## Data extraction -->
<!-- From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: location of study, methodology, cycling uptake and lighting measurements, mode, sign of association, and authors and year. -->

# Results

<Subject area>The scientific literature was found to be broadly spread
across several disciplines, including engineering and technology,
transportation, road safety, and public health.

<Themes>Five main themes emerged: 1. Cycling behaviour and lighting 2.
Cycling collisions and lighting 3. Cycling, crime and lighting 4.
Cycling inequalities in lighting 5. Proper lighting for cyclists
(i.e. optimal use of lighting to enhance cyclists reassurance while
respecting the environment)

<Visual>Figure 1 shows the number of papers reviewed by theme and year
of publication.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/fig2-1.png)<!-- -->

<Study type>Most of the studies were empirical papers (53) and a few
were reviews (9).
<!-- <type of empirical papers> Most of the empirical studies were quantitative (), five of them qualitative, and one of them mixed methods. -->

## Cycling behaviour and lighting

<!-- I could also divide the section on quantitative studies and objective and subjective. -->

Previous research has found a clear association between active travel or
physical activity levels and road lighting. For example, using odd
ratios to compare traffic flows in case and control hours, Steve Fotios
and Robbins (2022) found that darkness had a significant negative effect
on the number of pedestrians and cyclists, but not on the number of
motorized vehicles.

(Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022)

Using Strava Heatmap data and spatial regression models, Linchuan Yang
et al. (2022) found street lighting positively associated with running,
but not with cycling.

Using satellite and street view imagery and linear regressions,
Zacharias and Meng (2021) found street lighting highly significantly
associated with higher uptake and deposit of dock-less shared bicycle
trips.

Using odd ratios, Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace (2020) found that the
drop in cycling levels after dark was substantially greater in unlit
locations, compared with lit locations. Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace
(2020) also found a non-linear relationship between relative brightness
and the reduction in cyclists after-dark, suggesting that a minimal
amount of lighting could be enough to promote cycling after dark.

S. Fotios, Uttley, and Fox (2019) found that “ambient light has a
significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle
when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle
trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when
they are unlit”.

This supported previous work which “indicated the numbers of pedestrians
and cyclists during the case period were significantly higher during
daylight conditions than after-dark, resulting in a 62% increase in
pedestrians and a 38% increase in cyclists” (Uttley and Fotios 2017).

In a review of forty two quantitative studies that estimated association
between neighbourhood build environment and active travel in older
adults, Cerin et al. (2017) observed positive associations with
availability of street lights.

Using self-reported commuting data, Lin Yang et al. (2017) found that
individuals living in neighbourhoods with higher density of street light
were more likely to active commuting.

## Cycling collisions and lighting

One of the main reasons that cycling decreases in the dark is because
cyclists need to see obstacles on the road and be seen by other road
users.

The probability of suffering a traffic collision in the dark among
pedestrians and cyclists is much greater than among other road users.

Not only the frequency but also the severity of injury is higher at
night-time.

Most of the research on lighting and road safety is based on the US.

In the US the number of pedestrians fatally injured has increased
considerably in the last years, and this increase has been happened
particularly during the night (Ferenchak, Gutierrez, and Singleton 2022
and others). Compare with UK data.

“A pedestrian injured in the dark was found to be 5.0 times more likely
to be killed than a pedestrian injured during the day. While a lack of
street lighting does not seem to be the cause of the disproportionate
increase in pedestrian injuries at night, pedestrians struck without a
street light were 2.4 times more likely to be killed than those struck
in the presence of a street light” (Ferenchak, Gutierrez, and Singleton
2022).

A study on bicycle-motor vehicle crashes found that “crashes in low
light conditions and during early morning hours are more likely to
result in higher injury severity” (Asgarzadeh et al. 2018).

Papers on crashes during darkness in intersections.

Intersections: an study showed that “an increase in intersection
illuminance from low (\<0.2 fc) to medium (≥ 0.2 fc and \<1.1 fc) could
reduce nighttime crash frequency and night-to-day crash ratios by
approximately 50%. When illuminance was kept at 0.9 fc or higher, the
risk of fatality and severe injury decreased significantly, especially
in crashes that involved pedestrians and bicycles, head-on crashes, and
angle crashes” (Wei et al. 2016).

Nabavi Niaki et al. (2016) found that “an increase in road lighting was
associated with more bicycle and pedestrian accidents, which might have
been explained by the decision to add or increase the amount of lighting
at locations in which accidents occurred”.

Alcohol consumption. “The proportion of seriously injured cyclists who
have been drinking is highest in early morning darkness and has strongly
increased over the last decades” (Twisk and Reurings 2013).

“Injury accidents in on lit roads are reduced by 50%. The effect on
fatal accidents is slightly larger. The effect during twilight is about
2/3 of the effect in darkness. The effects on pedestrian, bicycle and
moped accidents are significantly larger than the effects on automobile
and motorcycle accidents. The risk of injury accidents was found to
increase in darkness. The average increase in risk was estimated to 17%
on lit rural roads and 145% on unlit rural roads. The average increase
in risk with respect to pedestrian accidents is about 140% on lit rural
roads and about 360% on unlit rural roads” (Wanvik 2009).

## Cycling, crime, and lighting

Another fundamental factor that explains less cycling during night-time
is fear of crime.

There is evidence that street lighting decreases crime and enhances
reassurance and confidence of pedestrians and cyclists after dark (e.g.
Loukaitou-Sideris (2006)).

People’s perceived nighttime safety (qualitative research):

“Danger was predicted by the pleasantness of the lighting, gender,
brightness and environmental trust” (Johansson, Rosén, and Küller 2011).

## Cycling inequalities in lighting

Fear of danger of injury from traffic, falls, or violence seems to
affect groups differently.

“Studies that focused on women, children, and the elderly have been able
to identify a stronger link between feelings of risk and fear at the
neighborhood and high levels of inactivity” (Loukaitou-Sideris 2006).

### Gender

“for pedestrians, the deterrence of darkness was similar for males and
females” (S. Fotios, Uttley, and Gorjimahlabani 2022).

“Women are more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than
men” (**xie_i?**\_2018).

“Women have a higher perceived risk of being assaulted/robbed/harassed
compared with men. At night, pedestrians perceived suburban environments
as insecure, and the change in the level of security was higher for
women than men. Also, night time security varied over different land-use
types between men and women” (Basu et al. 2021).

“the participating women in general, assessed the path as more dangerous
than did the men” (Johansson, Rosén, and Küller 2011).

### Age

Younger people can see better than older. A review on environments and
physical activity among children and youth found not a very consistent
positive associations between street lighting and physical activity
(Prince et al. 2022).

Older people may detect object differently than younger people.

### Disadvantaged groups

Qualitative research on perceptions of fear to crime and rashes of
cyclists from most deprived neighbourhoods (Lusk et al. 2019).

## Proper lighting for cyclists

A large number of papers found in our search focused on investigating
which type of road lighting is most appropriate to improve cyclists
reassurances. I.e. How lighting attributes such as illuminance, light
temperature, uniformity and glare, affect cycling.

Smart Street Lighting (that adapts to movement by pedestrians, cyclists,
and cars) papers.

“minimum illuminance is a better predictor of reassurance than is mean
illuminance. For a day–dark difference of 0.5 units on a 6-point
response scale, the results suggest a minimum horizontal illuminance of
approximately 2.0 lux” (S. Fotios, Monteiro, and Uttley 2019).

“Review of the characteristics of lighting suggests an optimum
illuminance of 10 lux, of high S/P ratio, and aimed toward the
pedestrian and natural elements of the environment, will enhance
reassurance” (S. Fotios, Unwin, and Farrall 2015).

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of cycling and lighting
is spread across several disciplines such as transportation, public
health, road safety, criminology, studies of social inequalities, and
engineering and technology.

**To what extent does darkness influence cycling behaviour?**

The positive results obtained in studies looking at the association
between cycling uptake and street lighting show the importance of light
conditions as a policy measure to encourage cycling in the dark.
Lighting conditions improvements not only may increase cycling trips in
general, but also the inclusivity of cycling, since, as has been
demonstrated, street lighting will benefit more certain sectors of
society such as women, children, the elderly, and certain disadvantaged
groups.

**To what degree does darkness increase the risk of road collision among
cyclists?**

**To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of
crime among cyclists?**

**Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between
different groups?**

**What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cycling to
increase and be safer?**

Other interesting questions to respond:

- What happens to people who do not cycle when it is dark? Do they
  change their routes? Do they change their mode of transport?

- Is traffic stress or darkness a bigger barrier to cycling (and impact
  of lighting)?

## Research gaps

- Lack of research in developing countries

- Methodological inconsistencies (see Loukaitou-Sideris (2006))

## Strenghts and limitations

# Conclusions

This paper reviewed published research at the intersection between
cycling and road lighting.

<gaps>Although there has been a recent growth of papers on this topic
the is still highly under-researched. More empirical work in the area of
cycling and road lighting is needed.

<!-- We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body. -->
<!-- During the project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations. -->
<!-- Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project. -->
<!-- Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety. -->
<!-- To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting [@fotios_pilot_2017], as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide. -->
