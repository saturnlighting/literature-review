Active Travel and Road Lighting: A Review
================

# Abstract

<!-- Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to investment in walking and cycling. -->
<!-- However, localised treatments such as appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on cyclability. -->

Background: There is evidence that darkness discourages people from
walking and cycling. This is basically due to two reasons. Darkness 1)
increases pedestrians’ and cyclists’ fear and likelihood of being
involved in a road collision and 2) increases fear and risk of being a
victim of a crime. This seems to affect disproportionately women, the
elderly, and disadvantaged groups. Aim: This paper provides a review on
the scientific literature that intersects between active travel and road
lighting. Method: We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing search
strategy. TBC studies on different disciplines such as transportation,
public health, road safety, criminology, social inequalities, and
engineering and technology we selected. Results: Our review suggests
that… Conclusion: The main gaps in the literature are…
<!-- Appropriate road lighting can increase feelings of reassurance among pedestrians and cyclists, as it helps them to see the route better during their trips as well as being more visible to other road users. It also helps reduce fear and risk of crime at night. -->
<!-- However, there is to date little evidence on the lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other measures. -->

<!-- Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling uptake, at all times and in all seasons? -->

# Introduction

Benefits of active travel are well established in the literature. A
large number of variables (individual, social, and environmental) can
affect an individual’s decision to walk and cycle. Darkness is one of
the environmental factors that has been found to affect walking the
most. Less studied has been the influence of darkness in cycling uptake.
<!-- - What type of street lighting is the most suitable for active trips at night to increase and be safer? -->

<!-- Papers that include darkness as a perceived barrier to cycling [@pearson_adults_2022]:  -->
<!-- @abasahl_gender_2018, -->
<!-- @agarwal_encouraging_2022, and -->
<!-- @akar_influence_2009. -->

There is no academic paper that reviews the international literature
available on the relationship between active travel and road lighting.

Fotios and Castleton (2017) provide a review of suggested actions to
enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists.
However, they focus only on cycling and in the UK.

Fotios, S., Unwin, J., Farrall, S. also wrte a review on rpad lighting
and pedestrian reassurance (Road lighting and pedestrian reassurance
after dark: A review).

Mention the rest of reviews included in the search.

This paper aims to review international research on the intersection
between active travel and road lighting.

The review answers the following questions:

1.- To what extent does darkness influence active travel uptake?

2.- To what extent is darkness associated with an increased risk of road
crash among active travellers?

3.- To what extent does darkness increase fear or risk among active
travellers of being a victim of crime?

4.- Is the association between active travel and darkness the same
between different groups?

5.- What type of street lighting is the most suitable for active travel
to increase and be safer?

This review focuses on road and/or ambient lighting and does not include
studies on safety lighting equipment for pedestrians or cyclists, such
as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights.

<!-- E.g. road lighting? -->

The review is organized as follows. Chapter 2 describes the method.
Chapter 3 presents the results of the papers reviewed. Chapter 4
critically analyses the results and identifies gaps in the research.
Chapter 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- Good practice review methodology: Scheepers et al., 2014. -->
<!-- ## Search strategy -->

We searched in SCOPUS electronic databased (on 11 Oct 2022) for studies
investigating the relationship between active travel and road lighting.
The query string used for the search was as follows:

> TITLE-ABS-KEY(“WALK*” OR ”FOOT” OR ”PEDESTRIAN*” OR “BICYCL*” OR
> ”BIK*” OR “CYCLING” OR “CYCLIST*” OR ”CYCLE HIRE” OR ”WHEEL*” OR
> “SCOOTER*” OR ”ROLLATOR*” OR “ACTIVE COMMUT*” OR ”ACTIVE TRANSPORT*”
> OR “ACTIVETRAVEL*” OR ”ECOLOGICAL COMMUT*” OR “ECOLOGICAL TRANSPORT*”
> OR ”ECOLOGICAL TRAVEL*” OR “GREEN\* COMMUT*” OR ”GREEN TRANSPORT*” OR
> “GREEN TRAVEL*” OR ”GREENWAY*” ) AND (“CITY LIGHT*” OR ”PUBLIC LIGHT*”
> OR “ROAD LIGHT*” OR ”ROAD ILLUMINATION” OR ”STREET LIGHT*” OR “STREET
> LAMP*” OR ”LAMP POST*” OR “LIGHT POST*” OR ”LIGHT POLE*”)

The search strategy resulted in 1227 records. Based on the examination
of titles, abstract, and then full papers 105 studies were selected. A
flow chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

<!-- Papers we could not access: -->
<!-- - A CONTROVERSIAL HISTORY OF PEDESTRIAN SPACE LIGHTING IN MOSCOW. -->
<!-- Safe on the move: The importance of the built environment (  Book Chapter) -->

<img src="flow-chart.png" alt="Review flow chart" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<!-- We need to define scope of the review - we are looking at papers that: Investigate the effects of light and lighting in some way, including road lighting or ambient light, but excluding other types of lighting such as cycle-mounted lighting Relate to cycling rates or cycling propensity, i.e. not related to cyclist safety? -->
<!-- Other parameters for scope? -->
<!-- ## Data extraction -->
<!-- From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: location of study, methodology, active travel uptake and lighting measurements, mode, sign of association, and authors and year. -->

# Results

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and road
lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation,
public health, road safety, criminology, social inequalities, and
engineering and technology.

## Active travel crashes and road lighting

## Physical activity, crime, and road lighting

## Inequalities in active travel and road lighting

Women more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men
(Xie and Spinney 2018).

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and
lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation,
public health, road safety, criminology, studies of social inequalities,
and engineering and technology.

## Research gaps

-   No research on wheeling and lighting

## Strenghts and limitations

-   Systematic but selection of papers we subjectively found more
    relevant. So there is more literature on this topic that has not
    been reviewed.

# Conclusions

<!-- Interpretation of the material. -->

The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work
in the area of active travel uptake and road lighting. We plan to
undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN
(Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which
has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body. During the
project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through
cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from
models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year
timescales and in a number of different locations. Comparing resulting
estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the
impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in
this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.
Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics
such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence
cycling rates and cyclist safety. To ensure the policy relevance of
future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the
findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost
effective investment in road and path lighting (Fotios et al. 2017), as
part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people
who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision
worldwide.
