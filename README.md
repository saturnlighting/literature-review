Road Lighting and Cycling Uptake: A review
================

<!-- Shouldn't be darkness instead of road lighting? -->
<!-- Alternative title:
- Ambient light, lighting, and cycling rates -->

**Abstract**

<Background>Many studies have explored the extent to which the built
environment (e.g. population density, land use mix, proximity, spatial
connectivity) and especially safe cycling infrastructure affects cycling
uptake. Less attention has been paid to the impact that
micro-environmental factors such as road lighting may have on people’s
choice to cycle. This paper provides a review of the scientific
literature on the relationship between road lighting and cycling uptake
and identifies existing gaps in research and knowledge. <Method>We used
a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. TBC empirical studies were
reviewed. These studies can be divided into those that use subjective
measurements and those that use objective measurements. <Results>Most of
the studies analysed suggest that road lighting has a strong positive
effect on cycling levels during the night. The impact is higher among
women. More research on the effect of road lighting specifically on
cycling is needed, including in developing countries, in countries with
different latitudes to most Western countries, and on the different
impact that road lighting has on cyclists of different ages and social
groups. <Conclusion>

<!-- To what extent darkness or lack of road lighting deter people from cycling? -->
<!-- Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to investment in cycling.  -->
<!-- However, localised treatments such as appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on cyclability.  -->
<!-- There is evidence suggesting darkness discourages people from cycling, and increases the risk of being involved in a collision whilst cycling.  -->
<!-- Appropriate road or path lighting can increase feelings of reassurance, make hazards more visible, and make the cyclist more visible to other road users.  -->
<!-- However, there is to date little evidence on the lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other measures.  -->
<!-- Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling uptake, at all times and in all seasons? -->

# Introduction

Benefits of cycling are well established in the literature. Cycling
improves physical, mental, and social health; reduces pollution, carbon
emissions, and congestion; and it is more inclusive than private
motorised modes, reducing inequalities (Oja et al. 2011). For this
reason, cycling is encouraged. Yet, most people keep choosing to drive
to cycle.

Many studies have explored the extent to which the built environment
(e.g. population density, land use mix, proximity, spatial connectivity)
and especially safe cycling infrastructure affects cycling uptake.
However, less investigated have been micro-built environmental factors
such as road lighting, which may have a strong influence on people
choice to cycle.

<!-- Previous research has found a positive association between street lighting and physical activity (PA) and active travel (AT) [@prince_examining_2022; @bonaccorsi_impact_2020]. -->

There is evidence suggesting that darkness discourages people from
cycling (e.g…). This is due to a higher perceived danger of cyclists at
night from motorised traffic and crime and personal security, which
disproportionately affect women, the elderly, and disadvantaged groups
(Schneider, Wiers, and Schmitz 2022).

<!-- Mention the rest of literature review fond in the search? -->

Previous academic literature reviews have touched on elements of the
relationship between cycling and lighting. For example, Fotios and
Castleton (2017) reviewed suggested interventions to enable cycling
lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists in the UK. Reynolds et
al. (2009) reviewed the impact of transport infrastructure, including
street lighting, on cycling collisions. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no academic paper has reviewed the international literature
available on the relationship between road lighting and cycling uptake.
This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature.

<!-- The review is guided by the following questions: -->
<!-- 1.  To what extent does darkness influence cycling behaviour? -->
<!-- 2.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among cyclists? -->
<!-- 3.  Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between different groups? -->

We focus on road lighting, excluding studies on lighting equipment for
cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights.

The review is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the method.
Section 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed. Section 4
critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the literature.
Section 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

## Search strategy

We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. First, we searched
in the SCOPUS electronic database (on 15 November 2022) for empirical
studies investigating the relationship between cycling and road
lighting. The query string used for the search was as follows:

*(bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR cyclist\* OR “cycle hire”) AND (“city
light\*” OR “public light\*” OR “road light\*” OR “street light\*” or
“city illumination” OR “public illumination” OR “road illumination” OR
“street illumination” OR “city lamp\*” OR “public lamp\*” OR “road
lamp\*” OR “street lamp\*” OR “lamp post\*” OR “light post\*” OR “light
pole\*”)*

This search, based on the content of the title, abstract, and keywords,
resulted in 262 records. After screening abstracts and full text, TBC
studies were selected. We excluded papers that did not focus on cycling
and road lighting (many studies mentioned cycling and lighting in
passing but not as the topic of the paper). We also excluded the papers
referring to how light influenced not cycling uptake but the road safety
of cyclists.

In the second stage, we checked the references from the studies selected
(i.e. snowball technique), and after screening abstracts and full texts,
TBC additional papers were selected. In total, TBC were reviewed. A flow
chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

## Data extraction

The following information was extracted from each manuscript: author(s)
and year, type of measurements, measurements for cycling and lighting,
method, location of study, and results (Table 1).
<!-- For analytical reasons, the type of measurements were classified into subjective and objective, depending on whether the associations were perceived (subjective) or objectively measured (objective). -->

# Results

## Trends of research

The scientific literature was found to be broadly spread across several
disciplines, including engineering, environmental science, social
science, and public health.

Most of the studies were written in the last decade, with 2022 being the
year in which the most studies on this topic were published (Figure 1).

reviewed](README_files/figure-gfm/fig2-1.png)

## Types of studies

Studies looking at the association between road lighting and cycling
uptake can be divided between those that used subjective measurements
and objective measurements.

“Subjective measures of reassurance are, however, prone to stimulus
range bias and socially desirable responding, and, as stated
preferences, it is unknown whether they are reflected in behaviour
(revealed preference). A more direct approach to investigating whether
changes in light influence walking and cycling is to count the number of
people using these transport modes in different light conditions. If
darkness reduces reassurance, then there will be fewer pedestrians and
cyclists. This has been investigated, and confirmed, in studies taking
advantage of variation in daylight, either the seasonal variation or the
sudden transition imposed by biannual daylight saving clock changes”
(Fotios, Uttley, and Gorjimahlabani 2022).

“The daylight savings method of analysis better isolates changes in
weather from the effects of ambient light on travel choice than does the
whole-year method” (Fotios, Uttley, and Fox 2019).

## Empirical findings

<!-- Add perhaps other reviews -->

The odds of cycling participation and duration was not higher in
participants who agreed that streets were well lit (Castillo-Paredes et
al. 2022).

Perception of poor light at night was not significantly associated with
people who reported traffic safety or personal security barriers to
cycling (Schneider, Wiers, and Schmitz 2022).

Using Strava Heatmap data and spatial regression models, Yang et al.
(2022) found street lighting positively associated with running, but not
with cycling.

Using odd ratios to compare traffic flows in case and control hours,
Fotios and Robbins (2022) found that darkness had a significant negative
effect on the number of pedestrians and cyclists, but not on the number
of motorized vehicles.

Using satellite and street view imagery and linear regressions,
Zacharias and Meng (2021) found street lighting highly significantly
associated with higher uptake and deposit of dock-less shared bicycle
trips.

Using odd ratios, Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace (2020) found that the
drop in cycling levels after dark was substantially greater in unlit
locations, compared with lit locations. Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace
(2020) also found a non-linear relationship between relative brightness
and the reduction in cyclists after-dark, suggesting that a minimal
amount of lighting could be enough to promote cycling after dark.

Fotios, Uttley, and Fox (2019) found that “ambient light has a
significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle
when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle
trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when
they are unlit”.

This supported previous work which “indicated the numbers of pedestrians
and cyclists during the case period were significantly higher during
daylight conditions than after-dark, resulting in a 62% increase in
pedestrians and a 38% increase in cyclists” (Uttley and Fotios 2017).

“Some bicyclists favor routes which are planted with street trees or
installed with street lights” (Chen, Shen, and Childress 2018).

In a paper that estimated welfare change associated with improvements in
urban bicycling facilities, Poorfakhraei and Rowangould (2015) found
that “cycle tracks were valued the most, followed by street lighting,
and bicycle lanes”.

“The presence of street lighting increased the likelihood of daily
cycling in \< 75 years old females and rural females but not in other
subgroups.” (Van Cauwenberg et al. 2012).

“Winters et al. (2011) found that a major deterrent to cycling was if
the route was not well lit after-dark. The deterrent effect was largest
for people who don’t currently cycle but potentially would do in the
future, highlighting the importance of lighting in encouraging uptake of
cycling” (Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace 2020).

Respondents in a study that examined if neighbourhood environments were
associated with walking and cycling, reported that good lighting at
night is an important facilitator of cycling (Lee and Moudon 2008).

“Nightfall was more of a deterrent to bicycling than walking” (Cervero
and Duncan 2003).

<!-- ## Cycling, crime, and lighting -->

Another factor that explains why there is less cycling at night is the
fear of crime. This is much less investigated than the relationship
between lighting and cycling collisions. There is evidence that street
lighting decreases crime and enhances reassurance and confidence of
pedestrians and cyclists after dark (e.g. Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022).

“Variables related to crime and lighting of public spaces were
associated with active travel in countries in Latin America”
(Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022).

<!-- @lusk_bicycle_2019 asked lower-income predominantly-minority residents what bicycle routes surface or context they perceived as safest from crime and crashes. They reported that "clean signs, balconies, cafes, street lights, no cuts between buildings, and flowers were low risk for crime and witnesses, little traffic, and bike signals low risk for crash".  -->
<!-- "Violent crimes appear to significantly deter people from choosing to walk or bicycle, potentially exposing themselves to threats of personal injury" [@appleyard_influence_2017]. -->
<!-- "High-crime neighborhoods tend to discourage residents from walking or riding a bicycle" [@ferrell_influences_2012]. -->
<!-- @cervero_travel_1997 "suggested that the presence of road lighting and the distance between lamps were significant aspects of neighbourhood design that contributed to encouraging non-automobile travel". -->
<!-- ## Cycling inequalities in lighting -->

Fear of danger of injury from traffic, falls, or violence seems to
affect groups differently.

<Gender>

Fotios, Uttley, and Gorjimahlabani (2022) found that darkness has a
greater deterrent effect on female cyclists than on male cyclists.

“Recent research (Sustrans 2018) found that only 23% of women felt safe
cycling during hours of darkness, compared with 36% of men, which
suggests that Lighting may also contribute to addressing the current
gender imbalance in cycling by encouraging more women to cycle
after-dark” (Uttley, Fotios, and Lovelace 2020).

“Women are less likely to cycle to work in the dark, so women are more
sensitive to the absence of daylight” (Heinen, Maat, and Wee 2011).

“Darkness was also more important to women than to men, but with a mean
grading of 3.0 in the survey of 1998, and 2.7 in the survey of 2000,
this factor could still not, not even for women, be considered to be
important in the choice of mode” (Bergström and Magnusson 2003).

<!-- "Women are more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men" [@xie_i_2018]. -->

<Age>

“Children whose routes had a high density of streetlights were less
likely to cycle to school” (Panter et al. 2010).

<Disadvantaged groups>

“Both traffic safety concerns and personal security concerns were most
strongly associated with poor neighborhood opportunities for exercise.
Respondents living in lower-income communities reported greater barriers
to pedestrian and bicycle safety and security than residents from
wealthier neighborhoods” (Schneider, Wiers, and Schmitz 2022).

“The dominant deterrents to bicycle commuting are unpleasant weather and
inadequate daylight” (Stinson and Bhat 2004)

# Discussion

Street lighting increases cyclists’ sense of safety at night by helping
them see and be seen by other road users during their journey. It also
provides them with a greater sense of security against possible threats
in the dark.

Street lighting provision. There may be a big differences between
countries. Urban density factor. Parks in Spain are all lighted, not the
same in the UK. E.g. 69.9% agree that streets are well lit Latin America
(Castillo-Paredes et al. 2022).

#### To what extent does darkness influence cycling uptake?

The positive results obtained in studies looking at the association
between cycling uptake and street lighting show the importance of light
conditions as a policy measure to encourage cycling in the dark.
Lighting conditions improvements not only may increase cycling trips in
general, but also the inclusivity of cycling, since, as has been
demonstrated, street lighting will benefit more certain groups such as
women.

#### Is this negative effect due to fear of being run over by motorirsed traffic or a victim of crime in the dark?

#### Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between different groups?

#### What happens to people who do not cycle when it is dark? Do they avoid their trips? Do they change their mode of transport? Do they change their routes?

#### What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cycling to increase and be safer?

## Research gaps

Based on these findings, we highlight the following research needs.

- Many studies fail to separate walking and cycling. The characteristics
  of environments encouraging walking may be different from those
  supporting cycling.

- More research in developing countries. “lack of street lighting can
  contribute to poor visibility, perception and fear of crime thus
  decreasing bicycle use. This is particularly relevant in SSA due to
  the generalized lack of security and safety.” (Mendiate et al. 2022).

- More research in locations with different latitudes to most Western
  countries. More extreme latitude locations have longer durations of
  darkness during parts of the year than countries at less extreme
  latitudes.

- We do not know whether there is difference in terms of age. Fotios,
  Uttley, and Gorjimahlabani (2022) considered age only for pedestrians.
  “The ORs for younger and older pedestrians were suggested to be
  significantly different (young OR = 1.58, old OR = 3.38, z = 3.800,
  p\<0.001), indicating that darkness is a greater deterrent to old
  pedestrians than to young pedestrians” (Fotios, Uttley, and
  Gorjimahlabani 2022). Also gender age groups are under-research. Do
  young female perceive cycling in the dark more dangerous than other
  women-age groups due to the risk of sexual assault?

- “If fewer people are walking or cycling after dark, the remainder must
  be doing something else instead. Consider three possibilities. First,
  they are making the same journey but instead driving using a personal
  motorized vehicle: darkness is a suggested factor in the choice of
  travel mode for short trips. Second, they are again making the same
  journey but using some form of shared motorized transport for some
  part of it, such as sharing a private vehicle or using public
  transport. Third, they are not leaving their home. This could be
  investigated by repeating the ambient light level analysis for
  motorized vehicles in addition to pedestrians and cyclists” (Fotios
  and Robbins 2022).

- Further research is needed to validate the optimum illuminance, the
  appropriate metric for characterising lamp spectral power
  distribution, and the most desirable aims of spatial distribution.

## Strenghts and limitations

<Strength>This paper provides a review of the scientific literature on
the relationship between road lighting and cycling uptake and identifies
existing gaps in research and knowledge. To the best of our knowledge,
no papers had looked at this association before.
<Limitations>Nevertheless, the paper has several limitations. Although
we used a hybrid systematic and snowballing search method to avoid
missing existing studies, we could have been more strict by using more
than one electronic database. We could have included the term ‘darkness’
in the query string? We do not include and analyse the controls used in
each of the studies.

# Conclusions

This paper reviewed published research on the intersection between road
lighting and cycling uptake.

<gaps>Despite the recent growth of articles on this subject, it is still
under-researched. More empirical work in the area of cycling and road
lighting is needed.

<!-- The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of cycling uptake (which means tackling the barriers to cycling including road safety and perceived personal safety) and lighting.  -->
<!-- We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body.  -->
<!-- During the project we plan to  measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations.  -->
<!-- Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.  -->
<!-- Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety.  -->
<!-- To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting (Fotios et al., 2017), as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide. -->
