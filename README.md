Active Travel and Road Lighting: A Review
================

# Abstract

<!-- Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to investment in walking and cycling. -->
<!-- However, localised treatments such as appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on cyclability. -->

There is evidence that darkness deters people from walking and cycling.
It increases the risk of being involved in a collision on the road as a
pedestrian or cyclist, and also increases the risk of being victim to
certain crimes. This disproportionately affects different social groups.

Appropriate road lighting can increase feelings of reassurance, make
hazards more visible, and make the pedestrians and cyclist more visible
to other road users. However, there is to date little evidence on the
lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other
measures.

This paper provides a review on the scientific literature that
intersections between active travel and road lighting.

<!-- Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling uptake, at all times and in all seasons? -->

# Introduction

<!-- - What type of street lighting is the most suitable for active trips at night to increase and be safer? -->
<!-- Papers that include darkness as a perceived barrier to cycling [@pearson_adults_2022]:  -->
<!-- @abasahl_gender_2018, -->
<!-- @agarwal_encouraging_2022, and -->
<!-- @akar_influence_2009. -->

There is no academic paper that reviews the international literature
available on the relationship between active travel and road lighting.
Fotios and Castleton (2017) provide a review of suggested actions to
enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists.
However, Fotios and Castleton (2017) focus on cycling safety and on
lighting for both bicycles and roads in the UK.

This paper aims to review international research on the intersection
between active travel and road lighting.

The review answers the following questions:

1.- To what extent darkness influences negatively active travel uptake?

2.- To what degree darkness is associated with higher risk on road
collisions among active travellers?

3.- To what extent darkness is associated with higher crime rates or
fear to crime among active travellers?

4.- Is this negative association between active travel and darkness
equally applicable to all groups?

Outside the scope of this review are technical engineering or smart
cities papers on the most suitable type of road lighting for active
travel. <!-- Concepts to define? -->

<!-- E.g. road lighting? -->

The review is organized as follows. Chapter 2 describes the search
strategy. Chapter 3 presents the results of the papers reviewed. Chapter
4 critically analyses the results and identifies gaps in the research.
Chapter 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Methodology

<!-- Good practice review methodology: Scheepers et al., 2014. -->
<!-- ## Search strategy -->

We searched in SCOPUS electronic databased (on 11 Oct 2022) for studies
investigating the relationship between active travel and road lighting.
The query string used for the search was as follows:

> TITLE-ABS-KEY(“WALK*” OR ”FOOT” OR ”PEDESTRIAN*” OR “BICYCL*” OR
> ”BIK*” OR “CYCLING” OR “CYCLIST*” OR ”CYCLE HIRE” OR ”WHEEL*” OR
> “SCOOTER*” OR ”ROLLATOR*” OR “ACTIVE COMMUT*” OR ”ACTIVE TRANSPORT*”
> OR “ACTIVETRAVEL*” OR ”ECOLOGICAL COMMUT*” OR “ECOLOGICAL TRANSPORT*”
> OR ”ECOLOGICAL TRAVEL*” OR “GREEN\* COMMUT*” OR ”GREEN TRANSPORT*” OR
> “GREEN TRAVEL*” OR ”GREENWAY*” ) AND (“CITY LIGHT*” OR ”PUBLIC LIGHT*”
> OR “ROAD LIGHT*” OR ”ROAD ILLUMINATION” OR ”STREET LIGHT*” OR “STREET
> LAMP*” OR ”LAMP POST*” OR “LIGHT POST*” OR ”LIGHT POLE*”)

The search strategy resulted in 1227 records. Based on the examination
of titles, abstract, and then full papers 105 studies were selected. A
flow chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

<!-- Selection of papers: SCOPUS search engine (any other? e.g. Google Scholar). -->
<!-- How have been systematically 'searched'? -->
<!-- Keywords used. -->
<!-- Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT). -->
<!-- Information to provide: Databases Languages included Keywords Search strategy -->
<!-- We need to define scope of the review - we are looking at papers that: Investigate the effects of light and lighting in some way, including road lighting or ambient light, but excluding other types of lighting such as cycle-mounted lighting Relate to cycling rates or cycling propensity, i.e. not related to cyclist safety? -->
<!-- Other parameters for scope? -->
<!-- ## Data extraction -->
<!-- From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: location of study, methodology, active travel uptake and lighting measurements, mode, sign of association, and authors and year. -->

# Results

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and road
lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation,
public health, road safety, criminology, and studies of social
inequalities.

## Active travel crashes and road lighting

## Physical activity, crime, and road lighting

## Inequalities in active travel and road lighting

Women more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men
(Xie and Spinney 2018).

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and
lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation,
public health, road safety, criminology, and studies of social
inequalities.

## Research gaps

-   No research on wheeling and lighting

## Strenghts and limitations

# Conclusions

<!-- Interpretation of the material. -->

The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work
in the area of active travel uptake and road lighting. We plan to
undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN
(Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which
has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body. During the
project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through
cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from
models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year
timescales and in a number of different locations. Comparing resulting
estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the
impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in
this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.
Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics
such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence
cycling rates and cyclist safety. To ensure the policy relevance of
future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the
findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost
effective investment in road and path lighting (Fotios et al. 2017), as
part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people
who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision
worldwide.
