Cycling Uptake and Road Lighting: A Review
================

# Abstract

Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have
received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to
investment in walking and cycling. However, localised treatments such as
appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on
cyclability. There is evidence suggesting darkness puts people off from
cycling, and increases the risk of being involved in a collision whilst
cycling. Appropriate road or path lighting can increase feelings of
reassurance, make hazards more visible, and make the cyclist more
visible to other road users. However, there is to date little evidence
on the lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other
measures. Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and
harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the
question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling
uptake, at all times and in all seasons?

# Introduction

Research suggests that darkness influences negatively cycling uptake.
But to what extent? Is this applicable to all groups of cyclists
equally? Is this due to fear of suffering a road collision or fear of
another type of threat (crime)? Does road lighting increase cycling
uptake during dark hours? If so, what type of road lighting would be the
most suitable to increase cycling uptake and cycling safety?

To the best of our knowledge, there is no academic paper that has
reviewed the international literature available on this specific area of
research. Fotios and Castleton (2017) provide a review of suggested
actions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of
cyclists. However, Fotios and Castleton (2017) focus on cycling safety
and lighting (for both bicycles and roads) in the UK.

This paper aims to review international research on the relationship
between cycling uptake and road lighting.

<!-- E.g. road lighting? -->

The review is organized as follows. Chapter 2 describes the search
strategy and the information extracted from the papers. Chapter 3
presents the results of the papers reviewed. Chapter 4 critically
analyses the results and identifies gaps in the research. Chapter 5
closes the work with the conclusions.

# Methodology

<!-- Good practice review methodology: Scheepers et al., 2014. -->

## Search strategy

We searched in two electronic databased (SCOPUS and Web of Science) for
studies investigating the impact of road lighting on cycling uptake. The
query string used for the search is as follows:

> TITLE-ABS-KEY ( “ACTIVE COMMUT*” OR ”ACTIVE TRANSPORT*” OR
> “ACTIVETRAVEL*” OR bicycl* OR bike\* OR biking OR”CYCLE HIRE” OR
> “CYCLING” OR “CYCLIST*” OR ”ECOLOGICAL COMMUT*” OR “ECOLOGICAL
> TRANSPORT*” OR ”ECOLOGICAL TRAVEL*” OR “GREEN\* COMMUT*” OR ”GREEN
> TRANSPORT*” OR “GREEN TRAVEL*” OR greenway* OR nonauto ) AND (”CITY
> LIGHT*” OR “PUBLIC LIGHT*” OR ”ROAD LIGHT*” OR “ROAD ILLUMINATION” OR
> “STREET LIGHT*” OR ”STREET LAMP*” OR “LAMP POST*” OR ”LIGHT POST*” OR
> “LIGHT POLE*” )

The search strategy resulted in 281 records. Based on the examination of
abstract and then full papers x studies were selected. A flow chart of
included studies is shown in Table 1.

# Discussion and research gaps

# Conclusions

<!-- Interpretation of the material. -->

The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work
in the area of cycling uptake (which means tackling the barriers to
cycling including road safety and perceived personal safety) and
lighting. We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months
in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night)
project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body.
During the project we plan to measure change in cycling levels,
primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as
inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over
multi year timescales and in a number of different locations. Comparing
resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help
assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else
to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research
project. Further work is needed to better understand how lighting
characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of
lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety. To ensure the
policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is
important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to
support cost effective investment in road and path lighting (Fotios et
al. 2017), as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the
benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and
wheeling provision worldwide.
