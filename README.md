Active Travel and Road Lighting: A Review
================

# Abstract

Background: A large body of evidence shows that darkness discourages
people from walking and cycling. This can be explained by the fear of
pedestrians and cyclists to suffer some type of damage from motorised
traffic, a fall, or some type of violence. This may disproportionately
affect women, the elderly, and disadvantaged groups.

Aim: This paper provides a review on the scientific literature that
intersects between active travel and road lighting to better understand
the relationship between both factors.

Method: We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. TBC studies
on several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road
safety, criminology, social inequalities, and engineering and technology
were reviewed.

Results: The literature suggests that… Gaps in the literature are…

Conclusion:

# Introduction

Benefits of active travel are well established in the literature. Active
travel (i.e. walking, cycling, and wheeling) improves physical, mental,
and social health; reduces pollution, carbon emissions, and congestion;
and it is more inclusive than private motorised modes, reducing
inequalities.

Many variables (individual, social, and environmental) can affect an
individual’s decision to travel by active modes, including by walking,
cycling, and wheeling (meaning by non-powered mobility devices, scooters
and other wheeled human powered vehicles).

Darkness is one of the environmental factors that most affect walking
and cycling. Less studied has been the influence of darkness on
wheeling, although we can assume that darkness is a major barrier to
wheeling because people who rely on wheeled mobility are among the most
vulnerable in society[^1].

Previous academic literature reviews have touched on elements of the
relationship between active travel and lighting. Cozens et al. (2003)
explored papers on the association between street lighting and crime or
fear of crime; S. Fotios and Castleton (2017) reviewed suggested
interventions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of
cyclists in the UK; Peter R. Boyce (2019) reviewed research into the
benefits of light at night for perceptions of safety; and several
reviews looked at studies on the appropriate lighting for pedestrians’
reassurance (S. Fotios, Unwin, and Farrall 2015; Fotios, S and Cheal, C.
2010; Steve Fotios and Castleton 2016). However, to the best of our
knowledge, no academic paper has reviewed the international literature
available on the relationship between active travel and road lighting
specifically.

<!-- Reviews on the relationship between build environment and active travel or physical activity considering lighting (e.g. @bonaccorsi_impact_2020; @mccormack_search_2011; @cerin_neighbourhood_2017; @prince_examining_2022).
Other reviews look at environment, crime, and physical activity (e.g. @foster_built_2008; @loukaitou-sideris_is_2006), or at street lighting and crime [@cozens_critical_2003]. 
@boyce_benefits_2019 wrote a review on the benefits of light at night in general. 
@fotios_lighting_2017 provide a review of suggested actions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists. However, they focus only on cycling and in the UK.
There are also a few reviews on appropriate road lighting [@fotios_light_2005; @fotios_s_road_2010; @fotios_specifying_2016]. -->

This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature, reviewing published
research specifically focussed at the intersection between active travel
and road lighting.

The review is guided by the following questions:

1.  To what extent does darkness influence active travel behaviour?

2.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of road collision
    among active travellers?

3.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of
    crime among active travellers?

4.  Is the association between active travel and darkness the same
    between different groups?

5.  What type of road lighting is the most suitable for active travel to
    increase and be safer?

We focus on road and/or ambient lighting, excluding studies on lighting
equipment for pedestrians or cyclists, such as reflective clothing or
bicycle-mounted lights.

The review is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the method.
Section 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed. Section 4
critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the literature.
Section 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- ## Search strategy -->

We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. First, we searched
in the SCOPUS electronic databased (on 11 Oct 2022) for studies
investigating the relationship between active travel and road lighting.
We searched for papers from 2000 to present. The query string used for
the search was as follows:

*walk\* OR foot OR pedestrian\* OR bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR
cyclist\* OR “cycle hire” OR wheel\* OR scooter\* OR “active commut\*”
OR “active transport\*” OR “active travel\*” OR “ecological commut\*” OR
“ecological transport\*” OR “ecological travel\*” OR “green\* commut\*”
OR “green transport\*” OR “green travel\*” OR greenway\*) AND (“city
light\*” OR “public light\*” OR “road light\*” OR “road illumination” OR
“street light\*” OR “street lamp\*” OR “lamp post\*” OR “light post\*”
OR “light pole\*”*

This search, based on the content of the title, abstract, and keywords,
resulted in 1227 records. After screening abstracts and full text, 56
studies were selected. We excluded papers that did not focus on active
travel and road lighting (many studies mentioned active travel and
lighting in passing but not as the topic of the paper). We excluded six
papers that could not be accessed.

In the second stage, we checked the references from the studies selected
(i.e. snowball technique), and after screening TBC abstracts and full
texts, TBC additional papers were selected. In total, TBC were reviewed.
All studies were in English languages and from 2000 up to 2022. A flow
chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

<!-- We need to define scope of the review - we are looking at papers that: Investigate the effects of light and lighting in some way, including road lighting or ambient light, but excluding other types of lighting such as cycle-mounted lighting Relate to cycling rates or cycling propensity, i.e. not related to cyclist safety? -->
<!-- Other parameters for scope? -->
<!-- ## Data extraction -->
<!-- From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: location of study, methodology, active travel uptake and lighting measurements, mode, sign of association, and authors and year. -->

# Results

The scientific literature was found to be broadly spread across several
disciplines, including transportation, public health, road safety,
criminology, social inequalities, and engineering and technology. Five
main themes were identified:

1.  Active travel behaviour and lighting

2.  Active travel collisions and lighting

3.  Active travel, crime and lighting

4.  Inequalities in lighting

5.  Proper lighting (i.e. optimal use of lighting to enhance reassurance
    while respecting the environment)

Figure 1 shows the number of papers reviewed for each of the identified
themes (some of the papers deal with more than one).

![](README_files/figure-gfm/fig2-1.png)<!-- -->

The main themes of focus, in descending order of number of papers
focussed on each, were active travel collisions and lighting, followed
by proper lighting for active travel, active travel behaviour and
lighting, inequalities in lighting, and active travel, crime, and
lighting. Three quarters of the studies were empirical studies and one
quarter were reviews. Most of the empirical studies were quantitative,
five of them qualitative, and one of them mixed methods.

## Active travel behaviour and lighting

There is evidence that street lighting influences physical activity and
active travel levels (Lee and Moudon 2008; McCormack and Shiell 2011;
Prince et al. 2022; Cerin et al. 2017; Annear et al. 2014; Peña-García,
Hurtado, and Aguilar-Luzón 2015; Lin Yang et al. 2017; Bonaccorsi et al.
2020).

Using Strava Heatmap data, Linchuan Yang et al. (2022), for example,
found lighting positively associations with running but not with
cycling.

Steve Fotios and Robbins (2022) found that “darkness leads to
significant reductions in pedestrians and cyclists but does not have a
significant effect on the number of motorized vehicles”.

Qualitative research suggests that street lighting influences perceived
safety and impacts the walkability of the neighbourhood (Rahm, Sternudd,
and Johansson 2021).

Zacharias and Meng (2021) found “street lighting highly significantly
associated with higher uptake and deposit of dock-less shared bicycle
trips”.

A subsequent paper found that the drop in cycling levels after dark was
substantially greater in unlit locations, compared with lit locations.
“Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater
reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some
lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness
at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small
initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the
difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this
effect reached a plateau as brightness increased” (Uttley, Fotios, and
Lovelace 2020).

Furthermore, previous work by S. Fotios, Uttley, and Fox (2019) suggests
that streetlighting can benefit bother walking and cycling. They found
that “ambient light has a significant impact: For a given time of day,
more people walk or cycle when it is daylight than after dark and more
people cycle on cycle trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they
are lit than when they are unlit”. This supported previous work which
“indicated the numbers of pedestrians and cyclists during the case
period were significantly higher during daylight conditions than
after-dark, resulting in a 62% increase in pedestrians and a 38%
increase in cyclists” (Uttley and Fotios 2017b). Overall, these studies
provided reason to take seriously a bolder finding: Lee and Moudon
(2008) found good lighting to be the most important facilitator of
walking and cycling. However, the relative importance of lighting,
compared with other factors, has not been the subject of large empirical
studies in the papers reviewed.

## Active travel collisions and lighting

One of the main reasons that active travel decreases in the dark is
because active travellers need to see obstacles on the road and be seen
by other road users.

The probability of suffering a traffic collision in the dark among
pedestrians and cyclists is much greater than among other road users
(e.g. Hennessy and Ai (2021); Wang and Cicchino (2020); John M. Sullivan
and Flannagan (2002)).

Poor visibility is one of the greatest risk factors for pedestrians
(Stoker et al. 2015).

Not only the frequency but also the severity of injury is higher at
night-time (Alogaili and Mannering 2022).

Most of the research on lighting and road safety based in the US.

In the US the number of pedestrians fatally injured has increased
considerably in the last years, and this increase has been happened
particularly during the night (Ferenchak, Gutierrez, and Singleton 2022
and others). Compare with UK data.

Recent papers have looked at the main factors of these crashes.

Hossain et al. (2022) found that “pedestrian alcohol/drug involvement as
the most frequent item in the dark-with-streetlight condition. This
crash type is particularly associated with pedestrian action (crossing
intersection/midblock), driver age (55–64 years), speed limit (30–35
mph), and specific area type (business with mixed residential area).
Fatal pedestrian crashes were found to be associated with roadways with
high speed limits (.50 mph) during the dark without streetlight
condition”.

“A pedestrian injured in the dark was found to be 5.0 times more likely
to be killed than a pedestrian injured during the day. While a lack of
street lighting does not seem to be the cause of the disproportionate
increase in pedestrian injuries at night, pedestrians struck without a
street light were 2.4 times more likely to be killed than those struck
in the presence of a street light” (Ferenchak, Gutierrez, and Singleton
2022).

Less research has been conducted in developing countries. In Bangladesh,
“seven significant factors influencing pedestrian-vehicle crash
severity, including crashes during dawn/dusk period and night period
(where street light was absent)” (Zafri et al. 2020)

In China, “the probabilities of fatal single-vehicle and
vehicle–pedestrian night-time accidents are also greater than that of
fatal vehicle–vehicle night-time accidents, by factors of 7.6 and 1.7,
respectively” (J. Liu et al. 2019).

A study on bicycle-motor vehicle crashes found that “crashes in low
light conditions and during early morning hours are more likely to
result in higher injury severity” (Asgarzadeh et al. 2018).

Papers on crashes during darkness in specific spots: intersections and
pedestrian crossings.

Pedestrian crossings: John M. Sullivan and Flannagan (2007) and Uttley
and Fotios (2017a).

Intersections: an study showed that “an increase in intersection
illuminance from low (\<0.2 fc) to medium (≥ 0.2 fc and \<1.1 fc) could
reduce nighttime crash frequency and night-to-day crash ratios by
approximately 50%. When illuminance was kept at 0.9 fc or higher, the
risk of fatality and severe injury decreased significantly, especially
in crashes that involved pedestrians and bicycles, head-on crashes, and
angle crashes” (Wei et al. 2016).

Nabavi Niaki et al. (2016) found that “an increase in road lighting was
associated with more bicycle and pedestrian accidents, which might have
been explained by the decision to add or increase the amount of lighting
at locations in which accidents occurred”.

Alcohol consumption. “The proportion of seriously injured cyclists who
have been drinking is highest in early morning darkness and has strongly
increased over the last decades” (Twisk and Reurings 2013).

“Injury accidents in on lit roads are reduced by 50%. The effect on
fatal accidents is slightly larger. The effect during twilight is about
2/3 of the effect in darkness. The effects on pedestrian, bicycle and
moped accidents are significantly larger than the effects on automobile
and motorcycle accidents. The risk of injury accidents was found to
increase in darkness. The average increase in risk was estimated to 17%
on lit rural roads and 145% on unlit rural roads. The average increase
in risk with respect to pedestrian accidents is about 140% on lit rural
roads and about 360% on unlit rural roads” (Wanvik 2009).

“The odds of sustaining a fatal injury are 49% lower at intersections
than at midblock locations under daylight conditions, 24% lower under
dark-with-street-lighting conditions, and 5% lower under
dark-without-street-lighting conditions. Relative to dark conditions
without street lighting, daylight reduces the odds of a fatal injury by
75% at midblock locations and by 83% at intersections, whereas street
lighting reduces the odds by 42% at midblock locations and by 54% at
intersections” (Siddiqui, Chu, and Guttenplan 2006).

## Active travel, crime, and lighting

Another fundamental factor that explains less walking and cycling during
night-time is fear of crime.

There is evidence that street lighting decreases crime and enhances
reassurance and confidence of pedestrians and cyclists after dark (e.g.
Rahm, Sternudd, and Johansson (2021); Loukaitou-Sideris (2006); Cozens
et al. (2003)).

“Perceived safety tends to affect the physical activity of groups
already known to exhibit greater anxiety about crime” (Foster and
Giles-Corti 2008).

People’s perceived nighttime safety (qualitative research):

“Proper street lighting is the main contributor to enhancing the feeling
of safety on streets” (Park and Garcia 2020).

“Important lighting attributes influencing people’s perceived safety are
identified as: lighting uniformity, facial recognition, concealment, and
perceived brightness. The findings further indicate that some
environmental context attributes, environmental perception attributes,
and socio-demographic attributes, also significantly influence people’s
perceived safety” (Wu and Kim 2016).

“Danger was predicted by the pleasantness of the lighting, gender,
brightness and environmental trust” (Johansson, Rosén, and Küller 2011).

## Inequalities in lighting

Fear of danger of injury from traffic, falls, or violence seems to
affect groups differently.

<!-- **fears from traffic** -->
<!-- **fears from crime** -->

“the study also found that age and gender influenced the level of
anxiety among pedestrians” (Park and Garcia 2020).

“Perceived safety tends to affect the physical activity of groups
already known to exhibit greater anxiety about crime” (Foster and
Giles-Corti 2008).

“Studies that focused on women, children, and the elderly have been able
to identify a stronger link between feelings of risk and fear at the
neighborhood and high levels of inactivity” (Loukaitou-Sideris 2006).

### Gender

“for pedestrians, the deterrence of darkness was similar for males and
females” (S. Fotios, Uttley, and Gorjimahlabani 2022).

“Women are more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than
men” (**xie_i?**\_2018).

“Women expressed a greater proportion of the comments related to
lighting (76%) and perceived safety (69%)” (Rahm, Sternudd, and
Johansson 2021).

“Women have a higher perceived risk of being assaulted/robbed/harassed
compared with men. At night, pedestrians perceived suburban environments
as insecure, and the change in the level of security was higher for
women than men. Also, night time security varied over different land-use
types between men and women” (Basu et al. 2021).

“the participating women in general, assessed the path as more dangerous
than did the men” (Johansson, Rosén, and Küller 2011).

### Age

Younger people can see better than older. A review on environments and
physical activity among children and youth found not a very consistent
positive associations between street lighting and physical activity
(Prince et al. 2022).

### Disadvantaged groups

Qualitative research on perceptions of fear to crime and rashes of
cyclists from most deprived neighbourhoods (Lusk et al. 2019).

## Proper lighting

A large number of papers found in our search focused on investigating
which type of road lighting is most appropriate to improve pedestrians
and cyclists reassurances. I.e. How lighting attributes such as
illuminance, light temperature, uniformity and glare, affect active
travel.

<!-- "R"eassurance describes the confidence a pedestrian might gain from road lighting (and other factors) to walk along a footpath or road after dark, and is intended to describe both perceived safety and fear of crime". -->

“A satisfactory level of FoS reaches at the illumination levels of 5–17
lx. People feel safer if nighttime light is warm and uniform.
Illuminance and uniformity are the main factors affecting PLQ under
conditions of low or high illuminance, while glare and color temperature
play a more significant role under high illuminance. In addition, a
satisfactory level of PLQ is found at illuminance levels of 25–35 lx and
light color temperature of 4000 K–5500 K” (M. Liu et al. 2022).

“Precise estimates of optimal illuminance, these ranging from 8.9 lx to
26 lx, depending on location” (B. Portnov et al. 2022).

“higher levels of illumination and uniformity positively affect FoS,
while lights perceived as warm tend to generate higher FoS than lights
perceived as cold” (B. A. Portnov et al. 2020).

“the necessary level of illumination required by urban residents to feel
safe differs by city and is significantly higher in Be’er Sheba, other
factors held equal, in compare to Haifa and Tel Aviv-Yafo” (Svechkina,
Trop, and Portnov 2020).

“minimum illuminance is a better predictor of reassurance than is mean
illuminance. For a day–dark difference of 0.5 units on a 6-point
response scale, the results suggest a minimum horizontal illuminance of
approximately 2.0 lux” (S. Fotios, Monteiro, and Uttley 2019).

“The reassurance of participants can be put in relation with street
lighting since changes in illuminance levels were highly perceived by
test participants. It was also found that reassurance is more related to
the mean horizontal illuminance than to the minimum illuminance or
minimum/average uniformity” (Mattoni et al. 2017).

“stimulus range bias in reassurance evaluations. This article also
recommends alternative methods for future research” (Steve Fotios and
Castleton 2016).

“Luminance and distance had significant effects on expression
recognition. A luminance of 1.0 cd/m2 permits facial expressions to be
identified with a 50% probability of correct identification at a
distance of 15 m” (B. Yang and Fotios 2015).

“Review of the characteristics of lighting suggests an optimum
illuminance of 10 lux, of high S/P ratio, and aimed toward the
pedestrian and natural elements of the environment, will enhance
reassurance” (S. Fotios, Unwin, and Farrall 2015).

<!-- There are more empirical papers very technical and most related to regulations which may be over the scope of this review (e.g. @fotios_proposed_2012; @fotios_using_2013; @fotios_using_2015).  -->
<!-- The same happens with a couple of reviews on this topic [@fotios_light_2005 and @fotios_s_road_2010]. Should we keep the reviews and remove emprical papers? Or remove them all? -->

“lamp SPD can be expected to affect the safe movement and perceived
safety of pedestrians at night-time” (**fotios_s?**\_road_2010).

“Relative safety need was determined by combining the dark/light ratio
with prevalence data to produce an idealized measure of lifesaving
potential. While all three scenarios suggested a potential for safety
improvement, scenarios related to high speed roadway environments showed
the greatest potential” (John M. Sullivan and Flannagan 2007).

“Models of mesopic vision predict that SPD is a significant variable in
that at a HPS photopic luminance of 0.100 cd/m2, MH need only produce
about 0.070-0.075 cd/m2 to be seen as equally bright” (S. Fotios, Cheal,
and Boyce 2005).

“These studies indicate that an average horizontal illuminance on a
parking lot surface or street sidewalk of about 30 Ix provides enough
light to ensure that perceptions of safety are close to what they are in
daylight” (P. R. Boyce et al. 2000).

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and
lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation,
public health, road safety, criminology, studies of social inequalities,
and engineering and technology.

**To what extent does darkness influence active travel behaviour?**

**To what degree does darkness increase the risk of road collision among
active travellers?**

**To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of
crime among active travellers?**

**Is the association between active travel and darkness the same between
different groups?**

**What type of road lighting is the most suitable for active travel to
increase and be safer?**

## Research gaps

-   Lack of research in developing countries

-   No research on wheeling and lighting

-   Measurement limitations (see Foster and Giles-Corti (2008)).

-   Methodological inconsistencies (see Loukaitou-Sideris (2006))

## Strenghts and limitations

-   Systematic but selection of papers we subjectively found more
    relevant. So there is more literature on this topic not reviewed.

# Conclusions

<!-- Interpretation of the material. -->
<!-- The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of active travel uptake and road lighting. -->
<!-- We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body. -->
<!-- During the project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations. -->
<!-- Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project. -->
<!-- Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety. -->
<!-- To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting [@fotios_pilot_2017], as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide. -->

    report by the charity Wheels for Wellbeing, for example, highlights
    the importance of mobility and active modes for disabled people. The
    report states that cycling “provides a sense of protection for those
    whose disability renders them visible and vulnerable when on foot”
    but does not discuss the impacts of darkness or lighting on feelings
    of vulnerability, reflecting gaps in the academic literature.
