,@poorfakhraei_estimating_2015,2015,qualitative,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,Estimating welfare change associated with improvements in urban bicycling facilities,"Cycle tracks were valued the most, followed by street lighting and bicycle lanes. Street lighting was valued much more than bicycle lanes, which are perhaps one of the most commonly added bicycle facilities. The results suggest that street lighting is something that future bicycle facility valuation and preference research should consider."
