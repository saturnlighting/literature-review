# Abstract

Background: There is evidence that darkness discourages people from walking and cycling. This is basically due to two reasons. Darkness increases pedestrians' and cyclists' fear and risk of 1) being involved in a road collision and 2) becoming victims of crime. This seems to affect disproportionately women, the elderly, and disadvantaged groups.
Aim: This paper provides a review on the scientific literature that intersects between active travel and road lighting.
Method: We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. TBC studies on several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, social inequalities, and engineering and technology were reviewed.
Results: The literature suggests that... Gaps in the literature are...
Conclusion: 

# Introduction

Benefits of active travel are well established in the literature. 
Active travel (i.e. walking, cycling, and wheeling) improves physical, mental, and social health; reduces pollution, carbon emissions, and congestion; and it is inclusive and reduces inequalities.

A large number of variables (individual, social, and environmental) can affect an individual's decision to travel actively. 
Darkness is one of the environmental factors that has been found to affect walking the most. Less studied has been the influence of darkness in cycling uptake, and there is practically no research regarding wheeling.

Some reviews have looked at elements of the relationship between active travel and enlightenment. @cerin_neighbourhood_2017 examined literature on the relationship between physical environment and active travel in general; @cozens_critical_2003 papers on the association between street lighting and crime or fear of crime; @boyce_benefits_2019 wrote a review on the benefits of light at night; and @fotios_lighting_2017 a review of suggested actions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists in the UK.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no academic paper has reviewed the international literature available on the relationship between active travel and road lighting specifically.

<!-- Reviews on the relationship between build environment and active travel or physical activity considering lighting (e.g. @bonaccorsi_impact_2020; @mccormack_search_2011; @cerin_neighbourhood_2017; @prince_examining_2022).
Other reviews look at environment, crime, and physical activity (e.g. @foster_built_2008; @loukaitou-sideris_is_2006), or at street lighting and crime [@cozens_critical_2003]. 
@boyce_benefits_2019 wrote a review on the benefits of light at night in general. 
@fotios_lighting_2017 provide a review of suggested actions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists. However, they focus only on cycling and in the UK.
There are also a few reviews on appropriate road lighting [@fotios_light_2005; @fotios_s_road_2010; @fotios_specifying_2016]. -->

This paper aims to fill this gap and provide a review on research on the intersection between active travel and road lighting.

The review is guided by the following questions:

1.- To what extent does darkness influence active travel behaviour?

2.- To what degree does darkness increase the risk of road collision among active travellers?

3.- To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among active travellers?

4.- Is the association between active travel and darkness the same between different groups?

5.- What type of road lighting is the most suitable for active travel to increase and be safer? 

This review focuses on road and/or ambient lighting and does not include studies on safety lighting equipment for pedestrians or cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights.

The review is organized as follows.
Chapter 2 describes the method.
Chapter 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed.
Chapter 4 critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the literature.
Chapter 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- ## Search strategy -->
We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method.
First, we searched in SCOPUS electronic databased (on 11 Oct 2022) for studies investigating the relationship between active travel and road lighting.
The query string used for the search was *walk\* OR foot OR pedestrian\* OR bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR cyclist\* OR "cycle hire" OR wheel\* OR scooter\* OR "active commut\*" OR "active transport\*" OR "active travel\*" OR "ecological commut\*" OR "ecological transport\*" OR "ecological travel\*" OR "green\* commut\*" OR "green transport\*" OR "green travel\*" OR greenway\*) AND ("city light\*" OR "public light\*" OR "road light\*" OR "road illumination" OR "street light\*" OR "street lamp\*" OR "lamp post\*" OR "light post\*" OR "light pole\*"*. This search resulted in 1227 records.
After screening abstracts and full text, TBC studies were selected.

Second, we checked all the references from the studies selected (i.e. snowball technique), and after screening their abstracts and full texts, TBC additional papers were selected. 
In total, TBC were reviewed. 
A flow chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

<!-- We need to define scope of the review - we are looking at papers that: Investigate the effects of light and lighting in some way, including road lighting or ambient light, but excluding other types of lighting such as cycle-mounted lighting Relate to cycling rates or cycling propensity, i.e. not related to cyclist safety? -->

<!-- Other parameters for scope? -->

<!-- ## Data extraction -->

<!-- From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: location of study, methodology, active travel uptake and lighting measurements, mode, sign of association, and authors and year. -->

# Results

The scientific literature found was spread across several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, social inequalities, and engineering and technology.
Five main themes were identified: 1) active travel behaviour and lighting, 2) active travel collisions and lighting, 3) active travel, crime and lighting, 4) inequalities in lighting, and 5) proper lighting (i.e. optimal use of lighting to enhance reassurance while respecting the environment).

The main themes of focus were proper lighting for active travel, followed by active travel collisions and lighting, and active travel behaviour and lighting. Many of the studies focused on more than one of these themes. 
A quarter of the studies were reviews, the rest were empirical studies.

The findings organized by these themes are shown below.

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, studies of social inequalities, and engineering and technology.

**To what extent does darkness influence active travel behaviour?**

**To what degree does darkness increase the risk of road collision among active travellers?**

**To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among active travellers?**

**Is the association between active travel and darkness the same between different groups?**

**What type of road lighting is the most suitable for active travel to increase and be safer?**

## Research gaps

-   No research on wheeling and lighting

## Strenghts and limitations

- Systematic but selection of papers we subjectively found more relevant. So there is more literature on this topic not reviewed. 

# Conclusions

<!-- Interpretation of the material. -->
The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of active travel uptake and road lighting.
We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body.
During the project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations.
Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.
Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety.
To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting [@fotios_pilot_2017], as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide.
