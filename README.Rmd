# Introduction

Benefits of cycling are well established in the literature.
Cycling improves physical, mental, and social health; reduces pollution, carbon emissions, and congestion; and it is more inclusive than private motorised modes, reducing inequalities (references needed). 
For this reason, cycling is being encouraged. Yet, most people keep choosing to drive to cycle.

One of the main determinants of cycling is fear of motorised vehicles (reference needed). 
Many studies have explored to what extent safe cycling infrastructure affects cycling (add brief conclusions of these studies here).
However, less investigated have been other micro-built environmental factors such as road lighting, which may have a strong influence on people's fear when cycling.

<!-- Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to investment in walking and cycling. However, localised treatments such as appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on cyclability. There is much evidence suggesting darkness puts people off from cycling, and increases the risk of being involved in a collision whilst cycling. Appropriate road or path lighting can increase feelings of reassurance, make hazards more visible, and make the cyclist more visible to other road users. However, there is to date little evidence on the lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other measures. Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling uptake, at all times and in all seasons? -->

Previous academic literature reviews have touched on elements of the relationship between cycling and lighting.
For example, @fotios_lighting_2017 reviewed suggested interventions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists in the UK. 
@reynolds_impact_2009 reviewed the impact of transport infrastructure, including street lighting, on cycling collisions.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no academic paper has reviewed the international literature available on the intersection between both terms, cycling and road lighting. 
This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature.

The review is guided by the following questions:

<!-- replace darkness with road lighting? -->

1.  To what extent does darkness influence cycling behaviour?

2.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of road collision among cyclists?

3.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among cyclists?

4.  Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between different groups?

5.  What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cycling to increase and be safer?


<!-- Other interesting questions to respond: -->

<!-- - What happens to people who do not cycle when it is dark? Do they change their routes? Do they change their mode of transport? -->

<!-- - Is traffic stress or darkness a bigger barrier to cycling (and impact of lighting)? -->

We focus on road and/or ambient lighting, excluding studies on lighting equipment for cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights.

The review is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the method.
Section 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed.
Section 4 critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the literature.
Section 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- ## Search strategy -->
<!-- Two methods were used to conduct the literature review: (a) a systematic search, and (b) additional smaller searches and snowballing.  -->
<!-- For completeness, separate smaller searches and snowballing were applied for the theoretical review as well as when the researchers were aware that a body of literature existed, but our systematic search had not picked up on it.  -->

We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method.
First, we searched in the SCOPUS electronic databased (on 15 November 2022) for studies investigating the relationship between cycling and road lighting.
The query string used for the search was as follows:

*(bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR cyclist\* OR "cycle hire") AND ("city light\*" OR "public light\*" OR "road light\*" OR "street light\*" or "city illumination" OR "public illumination" OR "road illumination" OR "street illumination" OR "city lamp\*" OR "public lamp\*" OR "road lamp\*" OR "street lamp\*" OR "lamp post\*" OR "light post\*" OR "light pole\*")* 

This search, based on the content of the title, abstract, and keywords, resulted in 262 records. 
After screening abstracts and full text, 46 studies were selected.
We excluded papers that did not focus on cycling and road lighting (many studies mentioned cycling and lighting in passing but not as the topic of the paper).

<!-- We excluded conference papers. -->

<!-- We excluded the following papers that could not be accessed: 

- Automated intelligent public lighting system

- Using of green energy from sustainable pavement plates for lighting bikeways

- Changing the DNA of city streets: NACTO's urban street design guide and the new city street design paradigm
-->

In the second stage, we checked the references from the studies selected (i.e. snowball technique), and after screening abstracts and full texts, 8 additional papers were selected.
In total, 54 were reviewed.
A flow chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Figure 1: flow chart", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("flow-chart.png")
```

<!-- ## Data extraction -->

<!-- From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: location of study, methodology, cycling uptake and lighting measurements, mode, sign of association, and authors and year. -->


# Results

<Subject area>The scientific literature was found to be broadly spread across several disciplines, including engineering, transport, road safety, and public health.

<Themes>Five main themes emerged:

1.  Cycling behaviour and lighting

2.  Cycling collisions and lighting

3.  Cycling, crime and lighting

4.  Cycling inequalities in lighting

5.  Proper lighting for cyclists 

<!-- (i.e. optimal use of lighting to enhance cyclists reassurance while respecting the environment) -->

<Study type>Most of the studies were written in the last decade, 46 were empirical and 8 were reviews (Figure 1).

<!-- <type of empirical papers> Most of the empirical studies were quantitative (), five of them qualitative, and one of them mixed methods. -->

## Cycling behaviour and lighting

<!-- I could also divide the section on quantitative studies and objective and subjective. -->

Previous research has found a positive association between street lighting and active travel and physical activity (references needed). 
Street lighting increases cyclists' sense of safety at night by helping them see and be seen by other road users during their journey. It also provides them with a greater sense of security against possible threats in the dark.

A recent review on differences and similarities in cycling between sub-Saharan African cities (SSA) and developed world cities (DWC) found that studies in both SSA cities and DWC are unanimous that street lighting has an important influence on cycling [@mendiate_cycling_2022]. "@ribbens_impact_2008 indicate that cyclists avoid poorly lit streets in the townships of South Africa. @buyana_gender_2014 indicate that "cyclists in the suburbs of Kampala are likely to forego a trip if the access road is not well-lit. Similarly, @winters_built_2010 in their study in Vancouver (Canada) cite that not well-lit bicycle lanes are strongly linked to the reduction of cycling rates. In addition, @chandra_street_2015 indicate that people avoid cycling in areas with cycle paths that do not have street lights at night" [@mendiate_cycling_2022].
"lack of street lighting can contribute to poor visibility, perception and fear of crime thus decreasing bicycle use. This is particularly relevant in SSA due to the generalized lack of security and safety." [@mendiate_cycling_2022].

In a review on research on built environment and physical activity among children and youth, prince_examining_2022 found street lighting positively associated with total physical activity among youth and children/youth, but not among children.

@luo_road_2022 found that nighttime brightness had pronounce effects on active travel.

Using Strava Heatmap data and spatial regression models, @yang_crowdsourced_2022 found street lighting positively associated with running, but not with cycling. 

Using odd ratios to compare traffic flows in case and control hours, @fotios_effect_2022 found that darkness had a significant negative effect on the number of pedestrians and cyclists, but not on the number of motorized vehicles.

Using satellite and street view imagery and linear regressions, @zacharias_environmental_2021 found street lighting highly significantly associated with higher uptake and deposit of dock-less shared bicycle trips.

"Elements positively associated with physical activity in older adults were (...) street lighting; crime-related safety; traffic-related safety. Negatively associated with physical activity were (…) barriers to walking/cycling; crime-related unsafety; unattended dogs; inadequate street lighting and upkeep; vandalism, etc." [@bonaccorsi_impact_2020].

Using odd ratios, @uttley_road_2020 found that the drop in cycling levels after dark was substantially greater in unlit locations, compared with lit locations. @uttley_road_2020 also found a non-linear relationship between relative brightness and the reduction in cyclists after-dark, suggesting that a minimal amount of lighting could be enough to promote cycling after dark.

"Pedestrians and cyclists have similar preferences for road segments with building lower than 6 floors, 50% retail shops in frontage, more greenery, lamps between 15 m and 30 m, more crossing facilities, wider sidewalk/bike lane and not crowded" [@liu_analysis_2020].

@fotios_whole-year_2019 found that "ambient light has a significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when they are unlit".

This supported previous work which "indicated the numbers of pedestrians and cyclists during the case period were significantly higher during daylight conditions than after-dark, resulting in a 62% increase in pedestrians and a 38% increase in cyclists" [@uttley_using_2017].

"Some bicyclists favor routes which are planted with street trees or installed with street lights" [@chen_gps_2018].

Using self-reported commuting data, @yang_longitudinal_2017 found that individuals living in neighbourhoods with higher density of street light were more likely to active commuting.

In a review of forty two quantitative studies that estimated association between neighbourhood built environment and active travel in older adults, @cerin_neighbourhood_2017 observed positive associations with availability of street lights.

In a paper that estimated welfare change associated with improvements in urban bicycling facilities, @poorfakhraei_estimating_2015 found that "cycle tracks were valued the most, followed by street lighting, and bicycle lanes".

Respondents in a study that examined if neighbourhood environments were associated with walking and cycling, reported that good lighting at night is an important facilitator of cycling [@lee_neighbourhood_2008].

## Cycling collisions and lighting

One of the main reasons that cycling decreases at night is cyclists' fear of not being seen in the dark and thus being hit by a motorised vehicle (reference needed).
The probability of suffering a traffic collision in the dark among pedestrians and cyclists is much greater than among other road users (e.g. @wiratama_joint_2022; @samerei_using_2021).
Not only the frequency of injuries but also their severity is higher at night-time [@asgarzadeh_impact_2018; @wang_statistical_2015].

"Certainly lighting condition is directly related with visibility which primarily affects the risk of accidents, but also affects severity due to lack of evasive action (e.g. driver did not see bicyclist) which leads to greater impact and thus severity" [@kim_bicyclist_2007]. 

@wiratama_joint_2022 found that children pedestrians and cyclists "involved in backover crashes with heavy vehicles and diminished light conditions had a 71% higher risk of sustaining Killed or seriously injured than those involved in crashes with other vehicles and optimal light conditions".

"It is found that unsafeness of interaction between rider and infrastructure depends on lighting and road surface meteorological conditions" [@malik_intelligent_2022].

@samerei_using_2021 found "that the factors that increase the risk of fatalities and serious injuries of bicyclists in all clusters are elderly bicyclist, not using a helmet, and darkness condition".

A study on bicycle-motor vehicle crashes found that "crashes in low light conditions and during early morning hours are more likely to result in higher injury severity" [@asgarzadeh_impact_2018].

"when cycling on a lit road, cycle lighting frequently offers no benefit for peripheral detection and may make it worse. It was demonstrated that position matters" [@fotios_pilot_2017].

"cyclist–motorist crashes were nonlinearly associated with light pole densities" [@osama_evaluating_2017].

"An increase in intersection illuminance from low (\<0.2 fc) to medium (≥ 0.2 fc and \<1.1 fc) could reduce nighttime crash frequency and night-to-day crash ratios by approximately 50%. When illuminance was kept at 0.9 fc or higher, the risk of fatality and severe injury decreased significantly, especially in crashes that involved pedestrians and bicycles, head-on crashes, and angle crashes" [@wei_safety_2016].

@nabavi_niaki_road_2016 found that "an increase in road lighting was associated with more bicycle and pedestrian accidents, which might have been explained by the decision to add or increase the amount of lighting at locations in which accidents occurred".

"Improving street lighting can decrease the likelihood of cyclist injuries" [@chen_built_2016].

"Inadequate use of lights in dark conditions were linked with increased injury severity" [@wang_statistical_2015].

"Most nighttime fatal crashes were related to absence of street lighting" [@lu_improving_2015].

"To improve visibility of pedestrians and cyclists, street lighting has been suggested as an intervention able to improve driver’s visual capabilities and ability to detect roadway hazards and to prevent car crashes" [@porchia_effectiveness_2014].

"Cycling in late evening darkness is associated with higher injury rates than cycling in daylight conditions. In comparison to late evening darkness, relative injury rates in early morning darkness are much higher. This is the case for crashes with large differences among the age groups, suggesting that in addition to the absence of daylight also age related risk factors are at play" [@twisk_epidemiological_2013].
"The proportion of seriously injured cyclists who have been drinking is highest in early morning darkness and has strongly increased over the last decades" [@twisk_epidemiological_2013].

"The presence of street lighting had a point estimate that indicated a reduction in the odds of a severe injury. Some aesthetic and safety items, such as streetlights and high surveillance showed a 30%–40% reduction in the odds of severe injury" [@romanow_environmental_2012].

"Street lighting is an additional factor that appear to improve cycling safety" [@reynolds_impact_2009].

"Darkness without streetlights increases the probability of fatal injury by 110.9% in accidents compared to accidents occurring in daylight or darkness with streetlights" [@kim_bicyclist_2007].

"Injury accidents in on lit roads are reduced by 50%. The effect on fatal accidents is slightly larger. The effect during twilight is about 2/3 of the effect in darkness. The effects on pedestrian, bicycle and moped accidents are significantly larger than the effects on automobile and motorcycle accidents. The risk of injury accidents was found to increase in darkness. The average increase in risk was estimated to 17% on lit rural roads and 145% on unlit rural roads. The average increase in risk with respect to pedestrian accidents is about 140% on lit rural roads and about 360% on unlit rural roads" [@wanvik_effects_2009].

"Variables that significantly increase injury severity include darkness" [@klop_factors_1999].

"The proportion of cyclists involved in fatalities at night increases with increase in age. Almost 80% of nighttime accidents occurred on links on arterial roads, and the majority in the high speed limit zones (75 kph and over). A greater proportion of accidents was initiated by cyclists. In 90% of nighttime cyclist fatalities the cyclist was hit from the rear, compared with 40% in daytime" [@mazharul_hoque_analysis_1990].

```

## Cycling, crime, and lighting

Another factor that explains why there is less cycling at night is the fear of crime. 
This is much less investigated than the relationship between lighting and cycling collisions.
There is evidence that street lighting decreases crime and enhances reassurance and confidence of pedestrians and cyclists after dark [e.g. @castillo-paredes_perceived_2022].

"Variables related to crime and lighting of public spaces were associated with active travel in countries in Latin America" [@castillo-paredes_perceived_2022].

@lusk_bicycle_2019 asked lower-income predominantly-minority residents what bicycle routes surface or context they perceived as safest from crime and crashes. They reported that "clean signs, balconies, cafes, street lights, no cuts between buildings, and flowers were low risk for crime and witnesses, little traffic, and bike signals low risk for crash". 

"Violent crimes appear to significantly deter people from choosing to walk or bicycle, potentially exposing themselves to threats of personal injury" [@appleyard_influence_2017].

"High-crime neighborhoods tend to discourage residents from walking or riding a bicycle" [@ferrell_influences_2012].

```{r tab6, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
df = papers %>%
  filter(crime == 1) %>% 
  select(authors, year, title, type)

kbl(df,
    caption = "Table 3: Overview of papers on cycling, crime, and lighting") %>%
    kable_styling()
```

## Cycling inequalities in lighting

Fear of danger of injury from traffic, falls, or violence seems to affect groups differently.

<Gender>

@fotios_extending_2022 found that darkness has a greater deterrent effect on female cyclists than male cyclists. 

<!-- "Women are more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men" [@xie_i_2018]. -->

<Age>


<Disadvantaged groups>

"Both traffic safety concerns and personal security concerns were most strongly associated with poor neighborhood opportunities for exercise. 
Respondents living in lower-income communities reported greater barriers to pedestrian and bicycle safety and security than residents from wealthier neighborhoods" [@schneider_perceived_2022].

```{r tab7, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
df = papers %>%
  filter(inequalities == 1) %>% 
  select(authors, year, title, type)

kbl(df,
    caption = "Table 4: Overview of papers on inequalities and lighting") %>%
    kable_styling()
```

## Proper lighting for cyclists

A substantial number of papers found in our search focused on what type of road lighting is best suited for cyclists.
That is, in investigating which lighting attributes, such as illuminance, light temperature, uniformity and glare, are the most appropriate to guarantee the safety of cyclists.

Some of these papers were on Smart Street Lighting. 
In other words, in lighting systems that adapts to the movement of pedestrians, cyclists, and cars (e.g. @gagliardi_advanced_2020; @abdullah_energy_2019; @juntunen_smart_2018).

"Light and glare from road lighting and headlights have significant impacts on vision and night driving and these effects are likely to change with evolving technologies" [@wood_nighttime_2020].

"LED road lighting for vehicular traffic roads generally fulfilled the requirements, whereas that for pedestrian and bicycle roads generally corresponded to the lowest lighting class for L, and often did not meet the statutory requirements for Uo and UI" [@jagerbrand_led_2016].

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of cycling and lighting is spread across several disciplines such as such as engineering, transport, road safety, and public health.

Below, based on the results of the review, we answer the questions that guide this paper.

#### To what extent does darkness influence cycling behaviour?

The positive results obtained in studies looking at the association between cycling uptake and street lighting show the importance of light conditions as a policy measure to encourage cycling in the dark. 
Lighting conditions improvements not only may increase cycling trips in general, but also the inclusivity of cycling, since, as has been demonstrated, street lighting will benefit more certain groups such as women, children, the elderly, and disadvantaged populations.

#### To what extent does darkness increase the risk of road collision among cyclists?

#### To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among cyclists?

#### Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between different groups?

#### What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cycling to increase and be safer?

## Research gaps

<!-- -   Lack of research in developing countries -->

## Strenghts and limitations

# Conclusions

This paper reviewed published research at the intersection between cycling and road lighting.

<gaps>Despite the recent growth of articles on this subject, it is still very little researched. More empirical work in the area of cycling and road lighting is needed.

<!-- We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body. -->

<!-- During the project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations. -->

<!-- Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project. -->

<!-- Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety. -->

<!-- To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting [@fotios_pilot_2017], as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide. -->
