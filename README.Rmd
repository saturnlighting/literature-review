# Abstract

Background: There is evidence that darkness discourages people from walking and cycling. This is basically due to two reasons. Darkness increases pedestrians' and cyclists' fear and risk of 1) being involved in a road collision and 2) becoming victims of crime. This seems to affect disproportionately women, the elderly, and disadvantaged groups.
Aim: This paper provides a review on the scientific literature that intersects between active travel and road lighting.
Method: We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method. TBC studies on several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, social inequalities, and engineering and technology were reviewed.
Results: The literature suggests that... Gaps in the literature are...
Conclusion: 

# Introduction

Benefits of active travel are well established in the literature. 
Active travel (i.e. walking, cycling, and wheeling) improves physical, mental, and social health; reduces pollution, carbon emissions, and congestion; and it is inclusive and reduces inequalities.

A large number of variables (individual, social, and environmental) can affect an individual's decision to travel actively. 
Darkness is one of the environmental factors that has been found to affect walking the most. Less studied has been the influence of darkness in cycling uptake, and there is practically no research regarding wheeling.

Some reviews have looked at elements of the relationship between active travel and enlightenment. @cerin_neighbourhood_2017 examined literature on the relationship between physical environment and active travel in general; @cozens_critical_2003 papers on the association between street lighting and crime or fear of crime; @boyce_benefits_2019 wrote a review on the benefits of light at night; and @fotios_lighting_2017 a review of suggested actions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists in the UK.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no academic paper has reviewed the international literature available on the relationship between active travel and road lighting specifically.

<!-- Reviews on the relationship between build environment and active travel or physical activity considering lighting (e.g. @bonaccorsi_impact_2020; @mccormack_search_2011; @cerin_neighbourhood_2017; @prince_examining_2022).
Other reviews look at environment, crime, and physical activity (e.g. @foster_built_2008; @loukaitou-sideris_is_2006), or at street lighting and crime [@cozens_critical_2003]. 
@boyce_benefits_2019 wrote a review on the benefits of light at night in general. 
@fotios_lighting_2017 provide a review of suggested actions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists. However, they focus only on cycling and in the UK.
There are also a few reviews on appropriate road lighting [@fotios_light_2005; @fotios_s_road_2010; @fotios_specifying_2016]. -->

This paper aims to fill this gap and provide a review on research on the intersection between active travel and road lighting.

The review is guided by the following questions:

1.- To what extent does darkness influence active travel behaviour?

2.- To what degree does darkness increase the risk of road collision among active travellers?

3.- To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among active travellers?

4.- Is the association between active travel and darkness the same between different groups?

5.- What type of road lighting is the most suitable for active travel to increase and be safer? 

This review focuses on road and/or ambient lighting and does not include studies on safety lighting equipment for pedestrians or cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights.

The review is organized as follows.
Chapter 2 describes the method.
Chapter 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed.
Chapter 4 critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the literature.
Chapter 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- ## Search strategy -->
We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method.
First, we searched in SCOPUS electronic databased (on 11 Oct 2022) for studies investigating the relationship between active travel and road lighting.
The query string used for the search was *walk\* OR foot OR pedestrian\* OR bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR cyclist\* OR "cycle hire" OR wheel\* OR scooter\* OR "active commut\*" OR "active transport\*" OR "active travel\*" OR "ecological commut\*" OR "ecological transport\*" OR "ecological travel\*" OR "green\* commut\*" OR "green transport\*" OR "green travel\*" OR greenway\*) AND ("city light\*" OR "public light\*" OR "road light\*" OR "road illumination" OR "street light\*" OR "street lamp\*" OR "lamp post\*" OR "light post\*" OR "light pole\*"*. This search resulted in 1227 records.
After screening abstracts and full text, TBC studies were selected.

Second, we checked all the references from the studies selected (i.e. snowball technique), and after screening TBC abstracts and full texts, TBC additional papers were selected. 
In total, TBC were reviewed. 
A flow chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

# Results

The scientific literature found was spread across several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, social inequalities, and engineering and technology.
Five main themes were identified: 1) active travel behaviour and lighting, 2) active travel collisions and lighting, 3) active travel, crime and lighting, 4) inequalities in lighting, and 5) proper lighting (i.e. optimal use of lighting to enhance reassurance while respecting the environment).

The main themes of focus were proper lighting for active travel, followed by active travel collisions and lighting, and active travel behaviour and lighting. Many of the studies focused on more than one of these themes. 
A quarter of the studies were reviews, the rest were empirical studies.

The findings organized by these themes are shown below.

## Active travel behaviour and lighting

There is evidence that street lighting influences physical activity and active travel levels [@lee_neighbourhood_2008; @mccormack_search_2011;
@prince_examining_2022; @cerin_neighbourhood_2017; @annear_environmental_2014; @pena-garcia_impact_2015; @yang_longitudinal_2017; @bonaccorsi_impact_2020].

Using Strava Heatmap data, @yang_crowdsourced_2022 found lighting positively associations with running but not with cycling.

@fotios_effect_2022 found that darkness leads to significant reductions in pedestrians and cyclists but does not have a significant effect on the number of motorized vehicles.

Qualitative research suggests that street lighting influences perceived safety and impacts the walkability of the neighbourhood [@rahm_evening_2021].

@zacharias_environmental_2021 found street lighting highly significantly associated with higher uptake and deposit of dock-less shared bicycle trips.

Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased [@uttley_road_2020].

@fotios_whole-year_2019 found that ambient light has a significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when they are unlit.

Odds ratios indicated the numbers of pedestrians and cyclists during the case period were significantly higher during daylight conditions than after-dark, resulting in a 62% increase in pedestrians and a 38% increase in cyclists [@uttley_using_2017].

@lee_neighbourhood_2008 found good lighting to be the most important facilitator of walking and cycling.

papers <- read.csv("lrp-papers-summary-full-text.csv")

df = papers %>%
  filter(behaviour == 1) %>% 
  select(authors, year, title, type)

kbl(df,
    caption = "Table 1: Overview of papers on active travel and lighting") %>%
    kable_styling()
```

## Active travel collisions and lighting

One of the main reasons that active travel decreases in the dark is because active travellers need to see obstacles on the road and be seen by other road users. 

The pobability of suffering a traffic collision in the dark among pedestrians and cyclists is much greater than among other road users (e.g. @hennessy_spatial_2021; @wang_fatal_2020).

Severity of crashes during the night is also more severe [@alogaili_differences_2022].

Most of the research on lighting and road safey based in the US.

In the US the number of pedestrians fatally injured has increaased considerably in the last years, and this increase has been happened particularly during the night [@ferenchak_shedding_2022 and others]. Compare with UK data.

Recent papers have looked at the main factors of these crashes. 

@hossain_applying_2022 found that pedestrian alcohol/drug involvement as the most frequent item in the dark-with-streetlight condition. This crash type is particularly associated with pedestrian action (crossing intersection/midblock), driver age (55–64 years), speed limit (30–35 mph), and specific area type (business with mixed residential area). Fatal pedestrian crashes were found to be associated with roadways with high speed limits (.50 mph) during the dark without streetlight condition.

Variables related to roadway design and operations (e.g., speed limits, number of lanes, roadway type, and presence of traffic control) are significantly associated with the likelihood of a pedestrian fatality or serious injury occurring in darkness as compared to daylight. Alcohol usage by drivers or pedestrians and sociodemographic characteristics were also positively associated with severe injuries in darkness [@sanders_pedestrian_2022].

A pedestrian injured in the dark was found to be 5.0 times more likely to be killed than a pedestrian injured during the day. While a lack of street lighting does not seem to be the cause of the disproportionate increase in pedestrian injuries at night, pedestrians struck without a street light were 2.4 times more likely to be killed than those struck in the presence of a street light [@ferenchak_shedding_2022].

Less research has been conducted in developing countries. In Bangladesh, seven significant factors influencing pedestrian-vehicle crash severity, including crashes during dawn/dusk period and night period (where street light was absent) [@zafri_exploring_2020].

In China, the probabilities of fatal single-vehicle and vehicle–pedestrian night-time accidents are also greater than that of fatal vehicle–vehicle night-time accidents, by factors of 7.6 and 1.7, respectively [@liu_exploring_2019]. 

A study on bicycle-motor vehicle crashes found that crashes in low light conditions and during early morning hours are more likely to result in higher injury severity [@asgarzadeh_impact_2018].

Papers on crashes during darkness in specific spots: intersections and pedestrian crossings.

Pedestrian crossings: @uttley_effect_2017.

Intersections: an study showed that an increase in intersection illuminance from low (<0.2 fc) to medium (≥ 0.2 fc and <1.1 fc) could reduce nighttime crash frequency and night-to-day crash ratios by approximately 50%. When illuminance was kept at 0.9 fc or higher, the risk of fatality and severe injury decreased significantly, especially in crashes that involved pedestrians and bicycles, head-on crashes, and angle crashes [@wei_safety_2016].


```{r tab5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df = papers %>%
  filter(road_safety == 1) %>% 
  select(authors, year, title, type)

kbl(df,
    caption = "Table 2: Overview of papers on active travel collisions and lighting") %>%
    kable_styling()
```

## Active travel, crime, and lighting

Another factor that seems to explain less use of walking and cycling is fear of crime.


```{r tab6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df = papers %>%
  filter(crime == 1) %>% 
  select(authors, year, title, type)

kbl(df,
    caption = "Table 3: Overview of papers on active travel, crime, and lighting") %>%
    kable_styling()
```

## Inequalities in lighting

Both the fear of having an accident and the fear of being a victim of crime seem to affect groups differently.

### Gender

Women are more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men [@xie_i_2018].

Women expressed a greater proportion of the comments related to lighting (76%) and perceived safety (69%) [@rahm_evening_2021].

### Age

Younger people can see better than older.

A review on environments and physical activity among children and youth found not a very consistent positive associations between street lighting and physical activity [@prince_examining_2022].

### Income

Qualitative research on perceptions of fear to crime and rashes of cyclists from most deprived neighbourhoods [@lusk_bicycle_2019].  

```{r tab7, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df = papers %>%
  filter(inequalities == 1) %>% 
  select(authors, year, title, type)

kbl(df,
    caption = "Table 4: Overview of papers on inequalities and lighting") %>%
    kable_styling()
```

## Proper lighting

```{r tab8, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df = papers %>%
  filter(proper_light == 1) %>% 
  select(authors, year, title, type)

kbl(df,
    caption = "Table 5: Overview of papers on proper lighting") %>%
    kable_styling()
```

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, studies of social inequalities, and engineering and technology.

**To what extent does darkness influence active travel behaviour?**

**To what degree does darkness increase the risk of road collision among active travellers?**

**To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among active travellers?**

**Is the association between active travel and darkness the same between different groups?**

**What type of road lighting is the most suitable for active travel to increase and be safer?**

## Research gaps

-   Lack of research on developing countries

-   No research on wheeling and lighting

## Strenghts and limitations

- Systematic but selection of papers we subjectively found more relevant. So there is more literature on this topic not reviewed. 

# Conclusions

<!-- Interpretation of the material. -->
<!-- The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of active travel uptake and road lighting. -->
<!-- We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body. -->
<!-- During the project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations. -->
<!-- Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project. -->
<!-- Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety. -->
<!-- To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting [@fotios_pilot_2017], as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide. -->
