# Abstract

Background: There is evidence that darkness discourages people from walking and cycling. This is basically due to two reasons. Darkness 1) increases pedestrians' and cyclists' fear and likelihood of being involved in a road collision and 2) increases fear and risk of being a victim of a crime. This seems to affect disproportionately women, the elderly, and disadvantaged groups.
Aim: This paper provides a review on the scientific literature that intersects between active travel and road lighting.
Method: We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing search strategy. 77 studies on several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, social inequalities, and engineering and technology were reviewed.
Results: Our review suggests that... Gaps in the literature are...
Conclusion: 

# Introduction

Benefits of active travel are well established in the literature. 
A large number of variables (individual, social, and environmental) can affect an individual's decision to walk and cycle. 
Darkness is one of the environmental factors that has been found to affect walking the most. Less studied has been the influence of darkness in cycling uptake. 

There is no academic paper that reviews the international literature available on the relationship between active travel and road lighting.

@fotios_lighting_2017 provide a review of suggested actions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists.
However, they focus only on cycling and in the UK.

<!-- Fotios, S., Unwin, J., Farrall, S. also wrte a  review on rpad lighting and pedestrian reassurance (Road lighting and pedestrian reassurance after dark: A review). -->

<!-- Mention the rest of reviews included in the search e.g. systematic review of the relationship between the built environment and physical activity.  -->

This paper aims to review international research on the intersection between active travel and road lighting.

The review answers the following questions:

1.- To what extent does darkness influence active travel uptake?

2.- To what extent is darkness associated with an increased risk of road crash among active travellers?

3.- To what extent does darkness increase fear or risk among active travellers of being a victim of crime?

4.- Is the association between active travel and darkness the same between different groups?

5.- What type of street lighting is the most suitable for active travel to increase and be safer? 

This review focuses on road and/or ambient lighting and does not include studies on safety lighting equipment for pedestrians or cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights.

The review is organized as follows.
Chapter 2 describes the method.
Chapter 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed.
Chapter 4 critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the research.
Chapter 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- ## Search strategy -->

We searched in SCOPUS electronic databased (on 11 Oct 2022) for studies investigating the relationship between active travel and road lighting.
The query string used for the search was as follows:

> TITLE-ABS-KEY("WALK*" OR "FOOT" OR "PEDESTRIAN*" OR "BICYCL*" OR "BIK*" OR "CYCLING" OR "CYCLIST*" OR "CYCLE HIRE" OR "WHEEL*" OR "SCOOTER*" OR "ROLLATOR*" OR "ACTIVE COMMUT*" OR "ACTIVE TRANSPORT*" OR "ACTIVETRAVEL*" OR "ECOLOGICAL COMMUT*" OR "ECOLOGICAL TRANSPORT*" OR "ECOLOGICAL TRAVEL*" OR "GREEN* COMMUT*" OR "GREEN TRANSPORT*" OR "GREEN TRAVEL*" OR "GREENWAY*" ) AND ("CITY LIGHT*" OR "PUBLIC LIGHT*" OR "ROAD LIGHT*" OR "ROAD ILLUMINATION" OR "STREET LIGHT*" OR "STREET LAMP*" OR "LAMP POST*" OR "LIGHT POST*" OR "LIGHT POLE*")

The search strategy resulted in 1227 records.
Based on the examination of titles, abstract, and then full papers 77 studies were selected.
A flow chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

<!-- We need to define scope of the review - we are looking at papers that: Investigate the effects of light and lighting in some way, including road lighting or ambient light, but excluding other types of lighting such as cycle-mounted lighting Relate to cycling rates or cycling propensity, i.e. not related to cyclist safety? -->

<!-- Other parameters for scope? -->

<!-- ## Data extraction -->

<!-- From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: location of study, methodology, active travel uptake and lighting measurements, mode, sign of association, and authors and year. -->

# Findings

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and road lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, social inequalities, and engineering and technology.

## Active travel crashes and road lighting

## Physical activity, crime, and road lighting

## Inequalities in active travel and road lighting

Women more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men [@xie_i_2018].

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of active travel and lighting is spread across several disciplines such as transportation, public health, road safety, criminology, studies of social inequalities, and engineering and technology.

## Research gaps

-   No research on wheeling and lighting

## Strenghts and limitations

- Systematic but selection of papers we subjectively found more relevant. So there is more literature on this topic that has not been reviewed. 

# Conclusions

<!-- Interpretation of the material. -->
The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of active travel uptake and road lighting.
We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body.
During the project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations.
Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.
Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety.
To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting [@fotios_pilot_2017], as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide.
