# Cycling Uptake and Road Lighting: A Review

## Abstract

Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to investment in walking and cycling.
However, localised treatments such as appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on cyclability.
There is much evidence suggesting darkness puts people off from cycling, and increases the risk of being involved in a collision whilst cycling.
Appropriate road or path lighting can increase feelings of reassurance, make hazards more visible, and make the cyclist more visible to other road users.
However, there is to date little evidence on the lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other measures.
Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling uptake, at all times and in all seasons?

## Introduction

The problem: Darkness seems to negatively influence cycling uptake.
This paper answers the question: How does road lighting/darkness affect cycling uptake?.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no academic paper in the transport literature that reviews this specific area of research.
This paper aims to fill this gap.
Any previous literature review not international or in a related area?
Fotios & Castleton, 2017.
Concepts to define?
E.g. road lighting or cycling.
cycling includes cycling, walking, and wheeling.
Review structure:

## Methodology

Good practice review methodology: Scheepers et al., 2014.
Selection of papers: SCOPUS search engine (any other? e.g. Google Scholar).
How have been systematically 'searched'?
Keywords used.
Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT).
Information to provide: Databases Languages included Keywords Search strategy

We need to define scope of the review - we are looking at papers that: Investigate the effects of light and lighting in some way, including road lighting or ambient light, but excluding other types of lighting such as cycle-mounted lighting Relate to cycling rates or cycling propensity, i.e. not related to cyclist safety?
Other parameters for scope?
Results (or state of knowledge) What is already known in this area (and maybe what is not)?
Present the literature in a logical way, commenting on the differences and similarities between the material cited.
Potential outputs of this section: state of knowledge, gaps in literature, weakness of methodologies used, structure on how dependent and independent variables are related (conceptual model?).

## Discussion and research gaps

## Conclusions

Interpretation of the material.

The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of cycling uptake (which means tackling the barriers to cycling including road safety and perceived personal safety) and lighting.
We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body.
During the project we plan to measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations.
Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.
Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety.
To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting (Fotios et al., 2017), as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide.
