<Conclusion>

<!-- To what extent darkness or lack of road lighting deter people from cycling? -->

<!-- Linear cycling infrastructure at ground level, such as cycle lanes, have received the bulk of research and policy attention in relation to investment in cycling.  -->
<!-- However, localised treatments such as appropriate lighting and cycle parking can have a major impact on cyclability.  -->
<!-- There is evidence suggesting darkness discourages people from cycling, and increases the risk of being involved in a collision whilst cycling.  -->
<!-- Appropriate road or path lighting can increase feelings of reassurance, make hazards more visible, and make the cyclist more visible to other road users.  -->
<!-- However, there is to date little evidence on the lighting interventions that work best, in combination with other measures.  -->
<!-- Lighting after dark has costs, both in terms of energy use and harmful ecological effects due to excess light pollution, raising the question: what is the optimal use of lighting to enable safe cycling uptake, at all times and in all seasons? -->

# Introduction

Benefits of cycling are well established in the literature.
Cycling improves physical, mental, and social health; reduces pollution, carbon emissions, and congestion; and it is more inclusive than private motorised modes, reducing inequalities [@oja_health_2011]. 
For this reason, cycling is encouraged. Yet, most people keep choosing to drive to cycle.

Many studies have explored the extent to which the built environment (e.g. population density, land use mix, proximity, spatial connectivity) and especially safe cycling infrastructure affects cycling uptake.
However, less investigated have been micro-built environmental factors such as road lighting, which may have a strong influence on people choice to cycle. 

There is evidence suggesting that darkness discourages people from cycling (e.g...). 
This is due to a higher perceived danger of cyclists at night from motorised traffic and crime and personal security, which disproportionately affect women, the elderly, and disadvantaged groups [@schneider_perceived_2022]. 

<!-- Mention the rest of literature review fond in the search? -->

Previous academic literature reviews have touched on elements of the relationship between cycling and lighting.
For example, @fotios_lighting_2017 reviewed suggested interventions to enable cycling lighting to contribute to the safety of cyclists in the UK. 
@reynolds_impact_2009 reviewed the impact of transport infrastructure, including street lighting, on cycling collisions.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no academic paper has reviewed the international literature available on the relationship between road lighting and cycling uptake.
This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature.

<!-- The review is guided by the following questions: -->

<!-- 1.  To what extent does darkness influence cycling behaviour? -->

<!-- 2.  To what extent does darkness increase the risk of being a victim of crime among cyclists? -->

<!-- 3.  Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between different groups? -->

We focus on road lighting, excluding studies on lighting equipment for cyclists, such as reflective clothing or bicycle-mounted lights.

The review is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the method.
Section 3 presents the findings of the papers reviewed.
Section 4 critically analyses the findings and identifies gaps in the literature.
Section 5 closes the work with the conclusions.

# Method

<!-- ## Search strategy -->
<!-- Two methods were used to conduct the literature review: (a) a systematic search, and (b) additional smaller searches and snowballing.  -->
<!-- For completeness, separate smaller searches and snowballing were applied for the theoretical review as well as when the researchers were aware that a body of literature existed, but our systematic search had not picked up on it.  -->

We used a hybrid systematic and snowballing method.
First, we searched in the SCOPUS electronic databased (on 15 November 2022) for empirical studies investigating the relationship between cycling and road lighting.
The query string used for the search was as follows:

*(bicycl\* OR bik\* OR cycling OR cyclist\* OR "cycle hire") AND ("city light\*" OR "public light\*" OR "road light\*" OR "street light\*" or "city illumination" OR "public illumination" OR "road illumination" OR "street illumination" OR "city lamp\*" OR "public lamp\*" OR "road lamp\*" OR "street lamp\*" OR "lamp post\*" OR "light post\*" OR "light pole\*")* 

This search, based on the content of the title, abstract, and keywords, resulted in 262 records. 
After screening abstracts and full text, TBC studies were selected.
We excluded papers that did not focus on cycling and road lighting (many studies mentioned cycling and lighting in passing but not as the topic of the paper).
We also excluded the papers referring to how light influenced not cycling uptake but the road safety of cyclists.

In the second stage, we checked the references from the studies selected (i.e. snowball technique), and after screening abstracts and full texts, TBC additional papers were selected.
In total, TBC were reviewed.
A flow chart of included studies is shown in Figure 1.

<!-- We removed the reviews such as: -->

<!-- - Cycling in sub-Saharan African cities: Differences and similarities with developed world cities -->

<!-- Paper we did not have access: -->

<!-- - S. Chandra, R. Radhakrishnan, Street visibility-dependent path finding for pedestrians and bicyclists in urban areas, Transportation Research Board 94th Annual Meeting, Transportation Research Board, Washington DC, United States, 2015. -->

## Data extraction

From the included studies, we extracted information regarding: author(s) and year, method, measurements, trip purpose, sign of association, location of study, sample size.

<!-- <type of empirical papers> Most of the empirical studies were quantitative (), five of them qualitative, and one of them mixed methods. -->

## Cycling behaviour and lighting

<!-- I could also divide the section on quantitative studies and objective and subjective. -->

Previous research has found a positive association between street lighting and physical activity (PA) and active travel (AT). In children [@prince_examining_2022] and older people [@bonaccorsi_impact_2020].

<!-- Add perhaps other reviews. I should not include reviews on our papers reviewed! -->

Street lighting increases cyclists' sense of safety at night by helping them see and be seen by other road users during their journey. It also provides them with a greater sense of security against possible threats in the dark.

A recent review on differences and similarities in cycling between sub-Saharan African cities (SSA) and developed world cities (DWC) found that studies in both SSA cities and DWC are unanimous that street lighting has an important influence on cycling [@mendiate_cycling_2022]. "@ribbens_impact_2008 indicate that cyclists avoid poorly lit streets in the townships of South Africa. @buyana_gender_2014 indicate that cyclists in the suburbs of Kampala are likely to forego a trip if the access road is not well-lit. Similarly, @winters_built_2010 in their study in Vancouver (Canada) cite that not well-lit bicycle lanes are strongly linked to the reduction of cycling rates. In addition, @chandra_street_2015 indicate that people avoid cycling in areas with cycle paths that do not have street lights at night" [@mendiate_cycling_2022].
"lack of street lighting can contribute to poor visibility, perception and fear of crime thus decreasing bicycle use. This is particularly relevant in SSA due to the generalized lack of security and safety." [@mendiate_cycling_2022].

In a review on research on built environment and physical activity among children and youth, prince_examining_2022 found street lighting positively associated with total physical activity among youth and children/youth, but not among children.

@luo_road_2022 found that nighttime brightness had pronounce effects on active travel.

Using Strava Heatmap data and spatial regression models, @yang_crowdsourced_2022 found street lighting positively associated with running, but not with cycling. 

Using odd ratios to compare traffic flows in case and control hours, @fotios_effect_2022 found that darkness had a significant negative effect on the number of pedestrians and cyclists, but not on the number of motorized vehicles.

Using satellite and street view imagery and linear regressions, @zacharias_environmental_2021 found street lighting highly significantly associated with higher uptake and deposit of dock-less shared bicycle trips.

"Elements positively associated with physical activity in older adults were (...) street lighting; crime-related safety; traffic-related safety. Negatively associated with physical activity were (…) barriers to walking/cycling; crime-related unsafety; unattended dogs; inadequate street lighting and upkeep; vandalism, etc." [@bonaccorsi_impact_2020].

Using odd ratios, @uttley_road_2020 found that the drop in cycling levels after dark was substantially greater in unlit locations, compared with lit locations. @uttley_road_2020 also found a non-linear relationship between relative brightness and the reduction in cyclists after-dark, suggesting that a minimal amount of lighting could be enough to promote cycling after dark.

"Pedestrians and cyclists have similar preferences for road segments with building lower than 6 floors, 50% retail shops in frontage, more greenery, lamps between 15 m and 30 m, more crossing facilities, wider sidewalk/bike lane and not crowded" [@liu_analysis_2020].

@fotios_whole-year_2019 found that "ambient light has a significant impact: For a given time of day, more people walk or cycle when it is daylight than after dark and more people cycle on cycle trails and walk on foot paths after dark when they are lit than when they are unlit".

This supported previous work which "indicated the numbers of pedestrians and cyclists during the case period were significantly higher during daylight conditions than after-dark, resulting in a 62% increase in pedestrians and a 38% increase in cyclists" [@uttley_using_2017].

"Some bicyclists favor routes which are planted with street trees or installed with street lights" [@chen_gps_2018].

Using self-reported commuting data, @yang_longitudinal_2017 found that individuals living in neighbourhoods with higher density of street light were more likely to active commuting.

In a review of forty two quantitative studies that estimated association between neighbourhood built environment and active travel in older adults, @cerin_neighbourhood_2017 observed positive associations with availability of street lights.

In a paper that estimated welfare change associated with improvements in urban bicycling facilities, @poorfakhraei_estimating_2015 found that "cycle tracks were valued the most, followed by street lighting, and bicycle lanes".

"The presence of street lighting increased the likelihood of daily cycling in < 75 years old females and rural females but not in other subgroups." [@van_cauwenberg_physical_2012].

"@winters_motivators_2011 found that a major deterrent to cycling was if the route was not well lit after-dark. The deterrent effect was largest for people who don’t currently cycle but potentially would do in the future, highlighting the importance of lighting in encouraging uptake of cycling" [@uttley_road_2020]. 

Respondents in a study that examined if neighbourhood environments were associated with walking and cycling, reported that good lighting at night is an important facilitator of cycling [@lee_neighbourhood_2008].

"Nightfall was more of a deterrent to bicycling than walking" [@cervero_walking_2003]. 

## Cycling, crime, and lighting

Another factor that explains why there is less cycling at night is the fear of crime. 
This is much less investigated than the relationship between lighting and cycling collisions.
There is evidence that street lighting decreases crime and enhances reassurance and confidence of pedestrians and cyclists after dark [e.g. @castillo-paredes_perceived_2022].

"Variables related to crime and lighting of public spaces were associated with active travel in countries in Latin America" [@castillo-paredes_perceived_2022].

@lusk_bicycle_2019 asked lower-income predominantly-minority residents what bicycle routes surface or context they perceived as safest from crime and crashes. They reported that "clean signs, balconies, cafes, street lights, no cuts between buildings, and flowers were low risk for crime and witnesses, little traffic, and bike signals low risk for crash". 

"Violent crimes appear to significantly deter people from choosing to walk or bicycle, potentially exposing themselves to threats of personal injury" [@appleyard_influence_2017].

"High-crime neighborhoods tend to discourage residents from walking or riding a bicycle" [@ferrell_influences_2012].

@cervero_travel_1997 "suggested that the presence of road lighting and the distance between lamps were significant aspects of neighbourhood design that contributed to encouraging non-automobile travel".

"Children whose routes had a high density of streetlights were less likely to cycle to school" [@panter_neighborhood_2010].


## Cycling inequalities in lighting

Fear of danger of injury from traffic, falls, or violence seems to affect groups differently.

<Gender>

@fotios_extending_2022 found that darkness has a greater deterrent effect on female cyclists than on male cyclists. 

"Recent research [@sustrans_bikelife_2018] found that only 23% of women felt safe cycling during hours of darkness, compared with 36% of men, which suggests that Lighting may also contribute to addressing the current gender imbalance in cycling by encouraging more women to cycle after-dark" [@uttley_road_2020].

"Women are less likely to cycle to work in the dark, so women are more sensitive to the absence of daylight" [@heinen_day_2011].

"Darkness was also more important to women than to men, but with a mean grading of 3.0 in the survey of 1998, and 2.7 in the survey of 2000, this factor could still not, not even for women, be considered to be important in the choice of mode" [@bergstrom_potential_2003].

<!-- "Women are more sensitive to dark spaces when walking and cycling than men" [@xie_i_2018]. -->

<Age>

<Disadvantaged groups>

"Both traffic safety concerns and personal security concerns were most strongly associated with poor neighborhood opportunities for exercise. 
Respondents living in lower-income communities reported greater barriers to pedestrian and bicycle safety and security than residents from wealthier neighborhoods" [@schneider_perceived_2022].

"The dominant deterrents to bicycle commuting are unpleasant weather and inadequate daylight" [@stinson_frequency_2004]

# Discussion

The scientific literature on the intersections of cycling and lighting is spread across several disciplines such as engineering, environmental science, social science, and public health were reviewed.

Below, based on the results of the review, we answer the questions that guide this paper.

In some cities the influence of road lighting will have a bigger impact than in others. For example in Madrid, Valencia and Seville there are around 2,900 hours of annual sunshine. Barcelona: 2,400. Compared to 1632 hours of sunlight per year in Oslo.

Street lighting provision. Big differences countries. Sprawl/dense urban areas. 69.9% agree that streets are well lit Latin America [@castillo-paredes_perceived_2022]. Spain vs the UK.

#### To what extent does darkness influence cycling uptake?

The positive results obtained in studies looking at the association between cycling uptake and street lighting show the importance of light conditions as a policy measure to encourage cycling in the dark. 
Lighting conditions improvements not only may increase cycling trips in general, but also the inclusivity of cycling, since, as has been demonstrated, street lighting will benefit more certain groups such as women, children, the elderly, and disadvantaged populations.

#### Is this negative effect due to fear of being run over by motorirsed traffic or a victim of crime in the dark?

#### Is the association between cycling and darkness the same between different groups?

#### What happens to people who do not cycle when it is dark? Do they avoid their trips? Do they change their mode of transport? Do they change their routes? 

#### What type of road lighting is the most suitable for cycling to increase and be safer?

#### Is traffic stress or darkness a bigger barrier to cycling (and impact of lighting)? -->

## Research gaps

- Many studies fail to separate walking and cycling. The characteristics of environments encouraging walking may be different from those supporting cycling.

- Differences in different latitudes.

<!-- -   Lack of research in developing countries -->

## Strenghts and limitations

- We do not know whether there is difference in terms of age. @fotios_extending_2022 considered age only for pedestrians. "The ORs for younger and older pedestrians were suggested to be significantly different (young OR = 1.58, old OR = 3.38, z = 3.800, p<0.001), indicating that darkness is a greater deterrent to old pedestrians than to young pedestrians" [@fotios_extending_2022].

# Conclusions

This paper reviewed published research on the intersection between cycling and road lighting.

<gaps>Despite the recent growth of articles on this subject, it is still under-researched. More empirical work in the area of cycling and road lighting is needed.


<!-- The review presented above highlights the need for more empirical work in the area of cycling uptake (which means tackling the barriers to cycling including road safety and perceived personal safety) and lighting.  -->

<!-- We plan to undertake some of this work over the coming months in the SATURN (Supporting Active Travel Using Road lighting at Night) project, which has been funded by the UK Research and Innovation body.  -->

<!-- During the project we plan to  measure change in cycling levels, primarily through cyclists counts, and cycling safety due to darkness as inferred from models of cycling levels and high resolution casualty over multi year timescales and in a number of different locations.  -->

<!-- Comparing resulting estimates of change in cycling and safety levels will help assess the impact of lighting in those locations, but there is much else to do in this field beyond what is possible in a 24 month research project.  -->

<!-- Further work is needed to better understand how lighting characteristics such as illuminance and the spatial distribution of lighting influence cycling rates and cyclist safety.  -->

<!-- To ensure the policy relevance of future work into road lighting and cycling, it is important that the findings feed into larger models of cycling uptake to support cost effective investment in road and path lighting (Fotios et al., 2017), as part of balanced packages of interventions, for the benefit of people who stand to benefit from better walking, cycling and wheeling provision worldwide. -->
